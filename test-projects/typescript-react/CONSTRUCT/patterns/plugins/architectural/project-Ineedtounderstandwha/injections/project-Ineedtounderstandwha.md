After reviewing the CLAUDE.md file for the TypeScript React project, I found that it contains general React and TypeScript development guidelines but does not contain specific content related to:

- MVVM patterns
- ViewModel implementations  
- @Published decorators
- Clean Architecture principles
- Business logic separation patterns
- Coordinator patterns
- Navigation patterns

The file focuses on standard React development practices like component-based architecture, custom hooks, and general code standards, but lacks the specific architectural patterns and business logic separation concepts requested.

**Result: No relevant content found matching the specified criteria.**
