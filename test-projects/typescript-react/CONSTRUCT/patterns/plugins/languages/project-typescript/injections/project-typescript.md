Based on my analysis of the CLAUDE.md file, here is the extracted TypeScript-specific content related to language conventions and modern patterns:

## TypeScript Development Rules

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- All components must have proper prop types
- Follow React hooks best practices

## TypeScript Performance Patterns

- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

## TypeScript Testing Standards

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing

The file contains TypeScript-specific conventions and patterns but no Swift or Python content. The focus is on TypeScript with React, emphasizing strict typing, modern React patterns, performance optimization, and testing practices.
