Looking at the CLAUDE.md file for optimization-related content:

## Performance

- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Build System

- Vite for fast development builds

Based on the content in this CLAUDE.md file, these are the only optimization and performance-related patterns present. The file focuses on React/TypeScript patterns rather than the SwiftUI LazyVStack patterns mentioned in the search keywords.
