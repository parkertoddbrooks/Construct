After analyzing the TypeScript React project's CLAUDE.md file, I found no content specifically related to shared models, API contracts, or multi-platform sync patterns. The file contains general TypeScript React development guidelines but does not include:

- Shared model definitions or patterns
- API contract specifications
- Cross-platform synchronization rules
- Multi-platform data sync patterns
- Data synchronization best practices

The content focuses on standard React/TypeScript development practices, build systems, and testing approaches rather than the requested multi-platform sync patterns.
