Based on my analysis of the CLAUDE.md file, here is the content related to design tokens, visual quality, accessibility, and component design patterns:

## Component Design Patterns

- Follow a component-based architecture with custom hooks for state management
- All components must have proper prop types
- Use styled-components for CSS-in-JS
- Implement error boundaries for robustness
- Storybook for component documentation

## Performance and Visual Quality

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()

The CLAUDE.md file contains basic React and TypeScript patterns but lacks specific design token implementations, detailed accessibility guidelines, or advanced component design patterns. The project appears to be using styled-components for styling but doesn't specify design token systems, color schemes, spacing systems, or accessibility standards.
