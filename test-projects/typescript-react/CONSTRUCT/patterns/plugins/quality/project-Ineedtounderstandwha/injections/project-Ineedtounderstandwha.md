Looking at the CLAUDE.md file for TypeScript React Project, I'll extract content related to professional standards, quality gates, empirical discoveries, and best practices:

```markdown
## Development Rules

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- All components must have proper prop types
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use styled-components for CSS-in-JS
- Implement error boundaries for robustness

## Code Standards  

- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Storybook for component documentation

## Performance

- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Build System

- Vite for fast development builds
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for containerized deployments
- Environment-specific configuration files

## Important Instructions

- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
```
