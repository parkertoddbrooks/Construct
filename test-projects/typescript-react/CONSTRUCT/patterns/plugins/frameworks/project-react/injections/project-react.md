- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()

### Performance Patterns
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Testing Standards
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Storybook for component documentation

### Build Configuration
- Vite for fast development builds
- Environment-specific configuration files
