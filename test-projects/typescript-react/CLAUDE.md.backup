# TypeScript React Project

## Architecture

This project uses TypeScript with React for the frontend. We follow a component-based architecture with custom hooks for state management.

## Development Rules

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- All components must have proper prop types
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use styled-components for CSS-in-JS
- Implement error boundaries for robustness

## Code Standards  

- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Storybook for component documentation

## Performance

- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Build System

- Vite for fast development builds
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for containerized deployments
- Environment-specific configuration files
