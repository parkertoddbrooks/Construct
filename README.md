# Construct

## 🌟 What is Construct?

Construct is an AI-powered architecture system that makes good code inevitable. Built on the **Pentagram Construct** - five points of intelligent protection that prevent architecture drift and maintain code quality automatically.

### The Five Points:

1. **Vision** (PRDs) - AI understands intent
2. **Memory** (Documentation) - AI remembers context  
3. **Prediction** (Pre-code Guidance) - AI suggests what exists
4. **Protection** (Enforcement) - AI guards quality
5. **Learning** (Monitoring) - AI evolves with codebase

## ✨ Features

### 🏗️ Complete Project Template
- **Pre-built MVVM architecture** with Swift 6 patterns
- **Design token system** for responsive, maintainable UI
- **Example features** (Login, Settings, Data Lists)
- **Testing foundation** with async/await support
- **Accessibility built-in** from day one

### 🤖 AI-Native Development
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md** that updates automatically
- **Multi-AI support** (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)
- **AI architectural guidance** prevents anti-patterns
- **Session continuity** at 90% context
- **Dynamic rule export** for any AI tool

### 🛡️ Self-Enforcing Architecture
- **Pre-commit hooks** catch violations before they're committed
- **Automated quality gates** (11 comprehensive checks)
- **PRD compliance** verification
- **Architecture drift prevention**
- **Professional standards** enforced

### 📊 Continuous Monitoring
- **Real-time project metrics**
- **Pattern library** extracted from your code
- **Violation tracking** with trends
- **Session summaries** preserve context
- **Architecture health scores**

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS 13.0+
- Xcode 15.0+ (Swift 6 support)
- Git
- Bash shell

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/construct.git YourProjectName
   cd YourProjectName
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./construct-setup
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Configure git hooks
   - Set up shell aliases
   - Initialize your project structure
   - Create your first CLAUDE.md

3. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open YourProjectName.xcodeproj
   ```

4. **Start building!**
   ```bash
   construct-before LoginFeature  # Check what exists before creating
   construct-new LoginFeature     # Create new feature from template
   ```
