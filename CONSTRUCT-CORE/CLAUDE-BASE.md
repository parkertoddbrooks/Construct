## Core Development Principles

These universal principles apply to ALL development work:

### ✅ DO: Foundation Rules
- **Never break existing tests** - Changes must maintain backward compatibility
- **Document why, not what** - Code should be self-explanatory, comments explain reasoning
- **Error handling is mandatory** - All failure modes must be handled gracefully
- **Security first** - Never expose secrets, validate all inputs, follow security best practices
- **Performance awareness** - Consider impact of changes on system performance
- **Version control discipline** - Clear commits, meaningful messages, atomic changes

### ❌ DON'T: Universal Anti-patterns
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Silent failures without error reporting
- Breaking changes without proper versioning
- Security vulnerabilities (exposed secrets, unvalidated inputs)
- Code without proper testing
- Undocumented complex logic
