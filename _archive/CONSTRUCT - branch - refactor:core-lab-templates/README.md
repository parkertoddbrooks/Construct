# CONSTRUCT 🏗️

**Dynamic context engineering for AI-powered development**

## The Context Problem

Claude Code changed everything. Unlike Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code forks that bolt AI onto 20-year-old IDE paradigms, Claude Code understood something fundamental: **the future of development isn't about editing code, it's about managing context**.

When I built my first app with Claude Code, I realized I only used two tools: Claude Code for development and GitHub Desktop for diffs. No file trees. No syntax highlighting. No extensions. As Indragie Karunaratne [discovered](https://www.indragie.com/blog/i-shipped-a-macos-app-built-entirely-by-claude-code) shipping a macOS app: "I have to imagine that there is a future in which IDEs look nothing like they do today." The centerpiece isn't a code editor anymore - it's context management and feedback loops.

But there's still friction. Every Claude Code session starts the same way: "We use MVVM architecture." "Swift files go here." "Follow these naming conventions." You paste in your `CLAUDE.md` file and hope for the best. Tools like [SwiftCatalyst](https://github.com/danielraffel/SwiftCatalyst) and Ray Fernando's [Swift Cursor Rules](https://www.rayfernando.ai/swift-cursor-rules) pioneered static rules for better AI assistance. But even the best static rules can't solve the core problem: **context needs to be dynamic**.

As Andrej Karpathy [points out](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626), we need "context engineering" not "prompt engineering." The art is filling the context window with exactly the right information for the task at hand. CONSTRUCT was born from this realization - while building an app with Claude Code, I was spending more time teaching it my patterns than actually building. The solution wasn't better static rules. The solution was making context aware of what I'm actually doing.

## What CONSTRUCT Does

CONSTRUCT dynamically assembles the perfect context based on your current task:

```yaml
# .construct/patterns.yaml
patterns:
  - languages/swift
  - architectural/mvvm-ios
  - integrations/stripe
  - ui/ios/standard-components
```

When you edit a Swift file, Claude gets Swift patterns. When you switch to shell scripts, it gets bash patterns. When you mention "User model", it knows to check all platforms where that model exists. **Your AI assistant finally understands context switching**.

## Features

### 🧠 Self-Improving Pattern System
- **Dynamic Context Assembly**: Loads relevant patterns based on what you're working on
- **Pattern Learning**: Identifies repeated code structures and suggests new patterns
- **Validation Feedback**: Patterns improve based on real usage
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically recognizes your tech stack and suggests patterns

### 🔌 Pattern Plugin Ecosystem (Like Homebrew for AI Context)
- **Browse & Install**: `construct search swift` finds all Swift patterns
- **Community Taps**: Share patterns without central approval
- **Private Registries**: Host company-specific patterns
- **Version Management**: Track pattern updates and dependencies

Each pattern includes:
- **📝 Rules**: The actual context and examples for AI
- **✅ Validators**: Pre-commit checks ensuring code follows the pattern
- **🏗️ Generators**: Create boilerplate code or visualizations from patterns

### ⚡ One-Click Everything
- **Integrations**: `construct add integration/stripe` - full MVVM-compliant integration
- **UI Components**: `construct add ui/ios/settings-screen` - complete, architected screens
- **Features**: `construct add feature/user-auth` - entire feature implementations
- **Cross-Platform**: Patterns that keep your models in sync across iOS/Android/Web

### 🏗️ Real Architecture Support
- **MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture**: First-class support for real patterns
- **Vendor Best Practices**: Integrations that follow vendor recommendations
- **Your Patterns**: Customize everything to match your team's style
- **Generated Code That Looks Hand-Written**: No obvious AI tells

## Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone CONSTRUCT
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/construct.git
cd construct

# For new projects
./CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/workspace/create-project.sh MyApp ios

# For existing projects
./CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/workspace/import-project.sh ../YourProject
```

### Using CONSTRUCT
```bash
# Add patterns to your project
construct add swift mvvm-ios
construct add integration/revenuecat
construct add ui/ios/paywall

# Update context
construct update
```

Now Claude Code knows your architecture, your patterns, your preferences - automatically.

## Built-in Patterns

### 🛠️ Core Patterns
- **Languages**: Swift, TypeScript, Python, C#, Go, Rust, Kotlin
- **Architectures**: MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture, MVC, MVP
- **Platforms**: iOS, macOS, watchOS, Android, Web, React Native

### 🚀 Enterprise Integrations
Stop copy-pasting vendor sample code. One command, proper architecture:

- **Analytics**: Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Segment
- **Payments**: Stripe, RevenueCat, Apple Pay, Google Pay
- **Auth**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase, Clerk
- **Chat**: Intercom, Zendesk, Crisp, Drift
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Bugsnag, Rollbar, LogRocket
- **Push**: OneSignal, Firebase, APNS, FCM

### 🎨 UI Component Library
Complete screens and components, in your architecture:

- **Screens**: Onboarding, Settings, Profile, Login, Subscription
- **Components**: Forms, Lists, Navigation, Loading States
- **Patterns**: Error Handling, Empty States, Pull-to-Refresh
- **Animations**: Transitions, Gestures, Haptics

## How It Works

### 1. Pattern Configuration
```yaml
# .construct/patterns.yaml
patterns:
  - languages/swift
  - architectural/mvvm-ios
  - "@company/design-system"
  - "github:expert/networking"
```

### 2. Automatic Context Assembly
CONSTRUCT watches what you're doing and loads the right patterns:
- Edit `UserViewModel.swift` → Swift + MVVM patterns active
- Edit `deploy.sh` → Bash + CI/CD patterns active  
- Mention "sync across platforms" → Cross-platform patterns activate

### 3. Pattern Development
Create patterns that capture your team's knowledge:
```bash
cd CONSTRUCT-LAB
./tools/create-pattern.sh "integration/new-service"
# Edit pattern, test with projects, share with community
```

### 4. Validators & Generators
Every pattern can include:
- **Validators**: Run before commits to ensure code matches patterns
  - Check naming conventions, architecture compliance, import structure
  - Generate reports showing what needs fixing
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- **Generators**: Create consistent code from patterns
  - Generate MVVM view/viewmodel pairs
  - Create integration boilerplate
  - Output architecture diagrams showing component relationships

## Real Impact

### Before CONSTRUCT
- 2-3 hours integrating Stripe, refactoring to match your architecture
- Explaining MVVM patterns every Claude session
- Copy-pasting the same boilerplate for every integration
- Teaching every new team member your patterns

### With CONSTRUCT
```bash
construct add integration/stripe
```
Done. Generated code looks like your team wrote it.

## Architecture (The Homebrew Model)

```
CONSTRUCT/
├── CONSTRUCT-CORE/     # Stable patterns (like brew formulae)
├── CONSTRUCT-LAB/      # Pattern development (like brew taps)
└── Projects/           # Your managed projects
```

Just like Homebrew:
- **CORE = Formulae**: Stable, proven patterns everyone uses
- **LAB = Taps**: Experimental patterns, company-specific patterns
- **No Gatekeepers**: Fork, modify, share without asking permission
- **Natural Selection**: Best patterns get adopted, bad ones fade away

Pattern structure:
```
patterns/integration/stripe/
├── pattern.md           # Rules and context for AI
├── metadata.yaml        # Version, dependencies
├── validators/
│   ├── check-service.sh # Ensures proper service layer
│   └── check-models.sh  # Validates data models
└── generators/
    ├── create-service.sh   # Generate Stripe service
    └── create-viewmodel.sh # Generate payment UI
```

## Requirements
- macOS 12.0+ or Linux (Windows via WSL)
- Git
- Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI assistant
- yq (`brew install yq`)

## Philosophy
- **Context > Prompts**: Right information beats clever wording
- **Dynamic > Static**: Adapt to what developers are actually doing
- **Patterns > Templates**: Composable, evolvable, shareable
- **Community > Committee**: Best patterns win, not "official" ones

## Contributing

The LAB environment is where patterns are born:
1. Notice a pattern in your code
2. Extract it to CONSTRUCT-LAB
3. Test with real projects
4. Share with the community

No gatekeepers. No committees. If it works, it's good.

## Coming Soon
- 🌐 Web-based pattern browser
- 🎯 VSCode & Cursor extensions  
- 📦 Single `construct` CLI tool
- 📊 Pattern analytics dashboard
- 🔄 Automatic pattern updates

## License

MIT - Good developer tools should be free.
