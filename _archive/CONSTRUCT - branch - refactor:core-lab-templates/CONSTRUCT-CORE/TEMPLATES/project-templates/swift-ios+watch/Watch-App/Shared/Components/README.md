# Watch Shared Components

Add your reusable SwiftUI components here that are shared across Watch features.

Examples:
- MetricDisplayView
- WatchButton
- LoadingIndicator
- ErrorView

Watch-specific considerations:
- Optimized for small screens
- Quick tap targets
- Minimal animations
- Energy efficient

This README can be deleted once you add your first component.
