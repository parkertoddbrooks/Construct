## CONSTRUCT Development Commands

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Development Workflow

1. **`construct-update`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct/update-context.sh`)
   - Updates CLAUDE.md with current project state
   - Run before starting a Claude session
   - Shows what components exist, violations, recent work

2. **`construct-check`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/core/check-architecture.sh`)
   - Checks for architecture violations
   - Verifies development patterns automatically
   - Shows hardcoded paths, duplication, template issues
   - **Use this to check development progress!**

3. **`construct-before ComponentName`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/core/before_coding.sh`)
   - Run before creating any new component
   - Shows what already exists
   - Prevents duplicates
   - Checks architectural alignment

4. **`construct-scan`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct/scan_project_structure.sh`)
   - Documents current CONSTRUCT structure
   - Creates timestamped snapshots
   - Archives old scans to `_old/`

5. **`construct-arch`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct/update-architecture.sh`)
   - Updates architecture documentation
   - Refreshes file trees and metrics

6. **`construct-quality`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/core/check-quality.sh`)
   - Checks shell script quality standards
   - Looks for common issues and anti-patterns
   - Validates configuration files

7. **`construct-docs`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/core/check-documentation.sh`)
   - Validates documentation coverage
   - Checks for missing function docs
   - Ensures README files exist

8. **`construct-session-summary`** (or `./CONSTRUCT/scripts/dev/session-summary.sh`)
   - Creates session summary when context is ~90%
   - Preserves work for next session
