# Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Did

Successfully migrated from the old structure to the new CORE/LAB/TEMPLATES architecture:

### Old Structure:
```
CONSTRUCT/
â”œâ”€â”€ CONSTRUCT-dev/      # Mixed development and core
â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT-TEMPLATE/   # Just Swift template
```

### New Structure:
```
CONSTRUCT/
â”œâ”€â”€ CONSTRUCT-CORE/     # Universal orchestration engine (clean, stable)
â”œâ”€â”€ CONSTRUCT-LAB/      # Your development environment
â”œâ”€â”€ TEMPLATES/          # Production-ready templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ swift-ios/     # Your Swift template
â””â”€â”€ _old/              # Original structure (preserved for reference)
```

## Key Changes

1. **CONSTRUCT-CORE** - Extracted universal components
   - Clean scripts without backup files
   - Version 1.0.0
   - Ready to embed anywhere

2. **CONSTRUCT-LAB** - Your development workspace
   - Uses CONSTRUCT-CORE via symlink
   - All your AI context, docs, and experiments intact
   - Same workflow, just renamed from CONSTRUCT-dev

3. **TEMPLATES/swift-ios** - Production Swift template
   - Uses CONSTRUCT-CORE via symlink
   - Ready for users to clone
   - Can add more templates later (nodejs, react, etc.)

## Symlinks Created

- `CONSTRUCT-LAB/CONSTRUCT â†’ ../CONSTRUCT-CORE`
- `TEMPLATES/swift-ios/USER-CHOSEN-NAME/CONSTRUCT â†’ ../../../CONSTRUCT-CORE`

## Verification

âœ… Scripts run successfully from LAB
âœ… Paths updated from CONSTRUCT-dev to CONSTRUCT-LAB
âœ… Validation updated to recognize new structure
âœ… Original files preserved in _old/

## Next Steps

1. Test your normal workflow in CONSTRUCT-LAB
2. Update construct-setup script for new template location
3. Consider what goes in orchestrator/ and adapters/
4. Add new templates as needed

## Your Workflow Stays the Same

```bash
cd CONSTRUCT-LAB
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-architecture.sh
# etc...
```

The only difference is the cleaner separation between:
- What you develop (LAB)
- What's stable (CORE)
- What users get (TEMPLATES)
