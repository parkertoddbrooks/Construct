# CONSTRUCT Pattern System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document unifies the pattern plugin system with the existing CONSTRUCT restructuring plans and TODOs, creating a cohesive implementation strategy that builds on what's already working.

## The Unified Vision

### What We're Building
A flexible pattern system where:
1. **CLAUDE-BASE.md** provides universal rules (in CONSTRUCT-CORE)
2. **Pattern plugins** offer optional/alternative patterns
3. **Projects assemble** their CLAUDE.md from base + selected plugins
4. **LAB enables** pattern development and testing
5. **Symlinks remain** for CONSTRUCT tools and documentation

### How It Fits With Existing Plans

#### From CONSTRUCT-RESTRUCTURE-PLAN-04.md:
- ✅ Keep the template-first architecture
- ✅ Keep the promotion system (LAB → CORE)
- **ADD**: Pattern plugin system alongside templates
- **ADD**: CLAUDE.md assembly instead of symlinks for context

#### From unified-claude-todo.md:
- ❌ **CHANGE**: Don't symlink CLAUDE.md everywhere
- ✅ **KEEP**: Unified context approach
- **NEW**: Assemble CLAUDE.md per project from patterns

#### From claude-md-mitigation-strategies.md:
- ✅ All mitigation strategies still apply
- **ENHANCED**: Pattern plugins naturally solve size/complexity issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Restructure for Pattern System

#### 1.1 Create Pattern Infrastructure
```bash
# In CONSTRUCT-CORE
mkdir -p patterns/plugins/languages      # Language-specific patterns
mkdir -p patterns/plugins/architectural  # Architecture patterns (MVVM, VIPER, etc.)
mkdir -p patterns/plugins/cross-platform # Multi-language coordination
mkdir -p patterns/plugins/tooling        # CONSTRUCT dev, CI/CD, etc.
mkdir -p patterns/lib                    # Pattern utilities
mkdir -p patterns/templates              # Default configurations
mkdir -p AI/examples                     # Referenced by patterns

# Create default patterns.yaml template
cat > patterns/templates/patterns.yaml << 'EOF'
# .construct/patterns.yaml
# Project-specific pattern configuration
# This file controls which patterns are active in your CLAUDE.md

# Languages used in this project
languages: []

# Active pattern plugins (from CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/)
plugins: []

# Project-specific rules (added to CLAUDE.md)
# Format: language -> list of rules
custom_rules: {}

# Pattern overrides (exceptions to base patterns)
# Format: pattern, exception, scope
overrides: []

# Include external pattern files (optional)
# Useful for large projects to modularize rules
includes: []
EOF

# In CONSTRUCT-LAB  
mkdir -p patterns/plugins                # Development patterns
mkdir -p patterns/experiments            # Pattern ideas
```

#### 1.2 Convert Current CLAUDE.md to Base + Plugins
```bash
# Current locations:
# - CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE.md (doesn't exist yet)
# - CONSTRUCT-LAB/CLAUDE.md (CONSTRUCT development)
# - RUN/CLAUDE.md (has valuable patterns)

# New structure:
CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE-BASE.md     # Core rules from all three
CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/
├── languages/
│   ├── swift.md                  # Swift language patterns
│   ├── csharp.md                 # C# language patterns
│   └── typescript.md             # TypeScript patterns
├── architectural/
│   ├── mvvm.md                   # MVVM pattern (from RUN)
│   ├── clean-architecture.md     # Clean Architecture pattern
│   └── viper.md                  # VIPER alternative
├── tooling/
│   ├── construct-dev.md          # CONSTRUCT development rules
│   └── ci-cd.md                  # CI/CD patterns
├── cross-platform/
│   └── model-sync.md             # Multi-language model synchronization
└── discoveries/
    ├── background-flash.md       # Discovered pattern from RUN
    └── watch-patterns.md         # Watch-specific from RUN
```

#### 1.3 Update File Structure (Building on RESTRUCTURE-PLAN-04)
```
CONSTRUCT-CORE/
├── CLAUDE-BASE.md                    # NEW: Base patterns
├── patterns/                         # NEW: Pattern system
│   ├── plugins/                      # Stable plugins
│   └── lib/                          # Pattern utilities
├── CONSTRUCT/
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   ├── assemble-claude.sh       # NEW: Builds CLAUDE.md
│   │   ├── create-project.sh        # UPDATED: Uses patterns
│   │   └── construct-patterns.sh    # NEW: Pattern control
│   └── adapters/                     # As planned
├── AI/
│   ├── template-structure/          # As planned
│   └── manifest.yaml                # UPDATED: Includes patterns
└── TEMPLATES/                        # As planned
```

### Phase 2: Build Pattern Assembly System

#### 2.1 Create `assemble-claude.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/assemble-claude.sh

# Assembles CLAUDE.md from base + selected plugins
# Usage: ./assemble-claude.sh <project-dir> <plugins> [--languages lang1,lang2] [--dry-run]

# Validate all plugins exist before assembly
IFS=',' read -ra PLUGIN_ARRAY <<< "$PLUGINS"
for plugin in "${PLUGIN_ARRAY[@]}"; do
    plugin=$(echo "$plugin" | xargs) # Trim whitespace

            find "$CONSTRUCT_CORE/patterns/plugins" -name "*.md" -type f | sed 's|.*/||' | sed 's|\.md$||' | sort
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
done

# Validate patterns.yaml if it exists
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
    if ! yq eval '.' "$CONFIG_FILE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "❌ Error: Invalid patterns.yaml format"
        echo "   File: $CONFIG_FILE"

## 🧠 Context Intelligence

### Active Language Contexts
Based on your project structure, I'll apply the appropriate patterns:

| File Pattern | Context Applied |
|-------------|-----------------|
| *.swift, *.xcodeproj | Swift patterns |
| *.cs, *.csproj | C# patterns |
| *.ts, *.tsx | TypeScript patterns |
| CONSTRUCT/**/*.sh | CONSTRUCT development |

### Cross-Platform Awareness
When you mention entities that exist across your stack, I'll consider all implementations:
- \"User model\" → Check Swift, C#, and TypeScript versions
- \"API endpoint\" → Consider backend implementation and client consumers
- \"Update schema\" → Propagate through all layers

#### 2.3 Create patterns.yaml Template
```yaml
# .construct/patterns.yaml
# Project-specific pattern configuration

# Languages used in this project
languages:
  - swift
  - csharp

# Active pattern plugins
plugins:
  - mvvm
  - cross-platform/model-sync
  - background-flash

# Project-specific rules (added to CLAUDE.md)
custom_rules:
  swift:
    - "Use 'Coordinator' suffix for navigation coordinators"
    - "Prefix private properties with underscore in ViewModels"
  csharp:
    - "Use 'Async' suffix for all async methods"
    - "Group related endpoints in partial controller classes"
  all:
    - "Add ticket number to TODO comments: // TODO (JIRA-123): Fix this"

# Pattern overrides (for exceptions to base rules)
overrides:
  - pattern: "mvvm/no-logic-in-views"
    exception: "Allow computed properties for pure UI calculations"
    scope: "swift"
```

#### 2.3 Update `create-project.sh`
```bash

### Phase 3: Implement Pattern Promotion & Validation

#### 3.1 Extend PROMOTE-TO-CORE.yaml
```yaml
# Existing file promotion
promotions:
  - type: file
    source: experiments/script.sh
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/script.sh
    
  # Pattern promotion
  - type: pattern
    source: patterns/plugins/new-pattern.md
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/new-pattern.md
    description: "Promotes tested pattern to stable"
    bump_version: minor
    
  # Project-specific pattern promotion
  - type: project-pattern
    source: ../RUN/patterns/custom-navigation.md
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/custom-navigation.md
    description: "Promotes project discovery to reusable plugin"
    bump_version: minor
```

#### 3.2 Add Pre-commit Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit (or CONSTRUCT-CORE/hooks/pre-commit)

# Validate CLAUDE.md hasn't been manually edited
VALIDATION_FAILED=false

for project in $(find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -not -path "*/CONSTRUCT-*/*"); do
    project_dir=$(dirname "$project")
    
    echo "Validating $project..."
    if ! ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct-patterns.sh validate "$project_dir"; then
        echo "❌ Pre-commit check failed: CLAUDE.md has been manually edited"
        echo "📝 To fix: Update .construct/patterns.yaml and run:"
        echo "   construct-patterns regenerate"
        VALIDATION_FAILED=true
    fi
done

if [ "$VALIDATION_FAILED" = true ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "⚠️  For advanced users: Use --no-verify to bypass (not recommended)"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All CLAUDE.md files are unmodified"
```

#### 3.3 Update promote-to-core.sh
```bash
# Add pattern promotion support
case "$type" in
  "file")
    # Existing logic
    ;;
  "pattern"|"project-pattern")
    # Validate pattern format
    if ! grep -q "^## \[" "$source"; then
        echo "❌ Pattern must start with ## [SCOPE] header"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Enhanced conflict detection - check for content overlap
    pattern_name=$(basename "$dest" .md)
    echo "🔍 Checking for conflicts with existing patterns..."
    
    # Extract rules section from new pattern
    NEW_RULES=$(sed -n '/^### Rules/,/^###/p' "$source" | grep -E "^- " || true)
    
    # Check each existing pattern for rule overlap
    for existing in "$CONSTRUCT_CORE/patterns/plugins"/**/*.md; do

            EXISTING_RULES=$(sed -n '/^### Rules/,/^###/p' "$existing" | grep -E "^- " || true)
            
            # Look for overlapping rules
            while IFS= read -r rule; do
                if echo "$EXISTING_RULES" | grep -F "$rule" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                    echo "⚠️  Rule overlap detected with $(basename "$existing"):"

                    [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && exit 1
                fi
            done <<< "$NEW_RULES"
        fi
    done
    
    # Check for explicit conflicts

        echo "⚠️  Pattern explicitly conflicts with existing patterns"
        read -p "Continue? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
        [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && exit 1
    fi
    
    # Copy pattern to CORE
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest")"
    cp "$source" "$dest"
    echo "✅ Pattern promoted to CORE: $dest"
    ;;
esac
```

### Phase 4: Migration from Current State

#### 4.1 Extract Patterns from Existing Files
1. **From CONSTRUCT-LAB/CLAUDE.md**:
   - Shell scripting rules → `tooling/shell-scripting.md` plugin
   - Symlink management → `tooling/construct-dev.md` plugin  
   - Promotion workflow → `tooling/construct-dev.md` plugin

2. **From RUN/CLAUDE.md**:
   - Background flash prevention → `discoveries/background-flash.md` plugin
   - Watch-specific patterns → `discoveries/watch-patterns.md` plugin
   - Swift MVVM patterns → `architectural/mvvm.md` plugin
   - Swift language rules → `languages/swift.md` plugin

3. **Create Initial CLAUDE-BASE.md**:
   ```markdown
   # CONSTRUCT Base Patterns
   
   ## Universal Development Principles
   - Never break existing tests
   - Document why, not what
   - Token-first development
   - Error handling is mandatory
   
   ## Multi-Context Awareness
   This context system understands your entire project stack.
   Language-specific patterns are applied based on file types.
   Cross-platform patterns help coordinate changes across languages.
   
   ## Pattern System
   See active patterns below. Toggle ✓/✗ to change what rules I follow.
   Say "reload patterns" after making changes.
   ```

4. **Create Cross-Platform Plugin**:
   ```markdown
   # cross-platform/model-sync.md
   
   ## Cross-Platform Model Synchronization
   
   When updating data models, consider all representations:
   
   ### Model Change Checklist
   - [ ] Update backend model (C#/Python/etc.)
   - [ ] Update database schema/migration
   - [ ] Update API DTOs/contracts
   - [ ] Update frontend models (Swift/TypeScript/etc.)
   - [ ] Update API client code
   - [ ] Update tests across all platforms
   
   ### Common Patterns
   1. **Adding a field**: Propagates through entire stack
   2. **Renaming**: Requires API versioning consideration
   3. **Removing**: Check for breaking changes
   4. **Type changes**: Validate serialization compatibility
   ```

#### 4.2 Test Migration Path
```bash
# Test with RUN project (Swift-heavy)
echo "Testing with RUN project..."
cd RUN
mv CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup

# Assemble new CLAUDE.md
../CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/assemble-claude.sh . \
  "swift-mvvm,watch-patterns,background-flash" --languages "swift"

# Verify all rules present
diff CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md

# Test with a C# backend project
echo "Testing with C# backend project..."
cd ../TEST_CSHARP_PROJECT
mv CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup

../CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/assemble-claude.sh . \
  "clean-architecture,api-patterns" --languages "csharp"

# Verify C# patterns applied correctly
grep "Clean Architecture" CLAUDE.md
grep "API patterns" CLAUDE.md

# Test with full-stack project
echo "Testing with full-stack project..."
cd ../TEST_FULLSTACK_PROJECT

../CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/assemble-claude.sh . \
  "mvvm,clean-architecture,cross-platform/model-sync" --languages "swift,csharp,typescript"

# Verify multi-language support
grep "Swift patterns" CLAUDE.md
grep "C# patterns" CLAUDE.md
grep "TypeScript patterns" CLAUDE.md
grep "Cross-Platform" CLAUDE.md

echo "✅ Migration testing complete"
```

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates

#### 5.1 Update README.md
- Explain pattern system
- Show both workflows (templates vs local)
- Document pattern creation

#### 5.2 Create Pattern Guide
```markdown
# patterns/PATTERN-GUIDE.md

## Understanding the Pattern System

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Don't Edit CLAUDE.md Directly!

Think of CLAUDE.md like a compiled binary (e.g., Photoshop's .exe file). You wouldn't edit Photoshop's binary to change a setting - you'd use the preferences menu. Similarly:

- ❌ **NEVER** edit CLAUDE.md directly
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `.construct/patterns.yaml` for customizations
- ✅ **CREATE** new pattern plugins for reusable patterns

### Why CLAUDE.md is Read-Only

1. **It's Generated**: Like compiled code, it's built from source files
2. **Updates Overwrite**: When patterns update, your changes are lost
3. **No Version Control**: Git can't track what changed in generated files
4. **Team Confusion**: Others won't know about your local modifications

## Creating a Pattern Plugin

### For Project-Specific Rules
Edit `.construct/patterns.yaml`:
```yaml
custom_rules:
  swift:
    - "Use 'Coordinator' suffix for navigation"
    - "Prefix private properties with underscore"
```

### For Reusable Patterns
1. Create in LAB: `CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/plugins/your-pattern.md`
2. Test locally by adding to `.construct/patterns.yaml`
3. Promote to CORE using `promote-to-core.sh`
4. Now all projects can use it!

## Pattern Format
```markdown
## [SCOPE] Pattern Name

### When to Use
- Specific use cases
- Problem this solves

### Rules
- ✅ DO: Positive patterns
- ❌ DON'T: Anti-patterns

### Examples
\`\`\`swift
// Good example
\`\`\`

### Conflicts
- conflicts: [other-pattern]
- overrides: [base-rule]
```

## Troubleshooting Manual Edits

If you accidentally edited CLAUDE.md:

1. **Backup your changes**: 
   ```bash
   cp CLAUDE.md my-custom-rules.txt
   ```

2. **Extract relevant rules**: Copy them to `.construct/patterns.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   custom_rules:
     swift:
       - "Your custom rule here"
   ```

3. **Regenerate CLAUDE.md**:
   ```bash
   construct-patterns regenerate
   ```

4. **Validate integrity**:
   ```bash
   construct-patterns validate
   ```

5. **Commit the right file**:
   ```bash
   git add .construct/patterns.yaml
   # NOT CLAUDE.md - it's generated!
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Why is CLAUDE.md read-only?**  
A: It's a generated file, like a compiled binary. Editing it directly causes divergence and breaks updates. Use patterns.yaml instead.

**Q: How do I add a project-specific rule?**  
A: Edit `.construct/patterns.yaml` and add your rule under `custom_rules`. Then run `construct-patterns regenerate`.

**Q: Can I override a base pattern?**  
A: Yes! Use the `overrides` section in patterns.yaml:
```yaml
overrides:
  - pattern: "mvvm/no-logic-in-views"
    exception: "Allow computed properties for pure UI calculations"
    scope: "swift"
```

**Q: What if my patterns.yaml gets too large?**  
A: Use the `includes` feature to modularize:
```yaml
includes:
  - custom/swift-rules.yaml
  - custom/api-patterns.yaml
```

**Q: How do I share patterns with my team?**  
A: Create a pattern plugin in CONSTRUCT-LAB, test it, then promote to CORE. This makes it available to all projects.

## Pattern Best Practices

1. **Start with patterns.yaml** - Only create plugins for truly reusable patterns
2. **Use clear scopes** - Mark patterns as [SWIFT], [C#], [ALL], etc.
3. **Document exceptions** - Explain when NOT to use a pattern
4. **Include examples** - Show both good and bad code
5. **Test before promoting** - Ensure patterns work across projects

## Advanced: Creating Complex Patterns

For patterns that need to modify multiple aspects:

```markdown
## [ARCHITECTURAL] Custom MVVM+ Pattern

### Metadata
conflicts: [standard-mvvm, viper]
requires: [swift-language, combine-framework]
overrides: [base-mvvm/viewmodel-naming]

### Rules
- ✅ ViewModels must use 'VM' suffix not 'ViewModel'
- ✅ All ViewModels inherit from BaseVM
- ❌ Don't use @ObservedObject for ViewModels

### Integration
When this pattern is active:
- Disable standard MVVM pattern
- Enable Combine framework patterns
- Override ViewModel naming conventions
```

Remember: The pattern system is designed to be flexible while maintaining consistency. When in doubt, check if your customization should be project-specific (patterns.yaml) or reusable (pattern plugin). plugins for reusable patterns

### Why CLAUDE.md is Read-Only

1. **It's Generated**: Like compiled code, it's built from source files
2. **Updates Overwrite**: When patterns update, your changes are lost
3. **No Version Control**: Git can't track what changed in generated files
4. **Team Confusion**: Others won't know about your local modifications

## If You've Already Edited CLAUDE.md

1. **Save your changes**: Copy custom rules to a temporary file
2. **Update patterns.yaml**: Add your rules to `custom_rules`
3. **Regenerate**: Run `construct-patterns regenerate`
4. **Verify**: Check your rules appear in the new CLAUDE.md
5. **Commit**: Only commit `.construct/patterns.yaml`, not CLAUDE.md
```

## Integration Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Create pattern directory structure
- [ ] Build assemble-claude.sh script
- [ ] Extract patterns from existing CLAUDE.md files
- [ ] Create initial CLAUDE-BASE.md

### Week 2: Assembly System  
- [ ] Implement pattern selection in create-project.sh
- [ ] Build construct-patterns control script
- [ ] Test with RUN project
- [ ] Document pattern format

### Week 3: Promotion & Polish
- [ ] Add pattern promotion to promote-to-core.sh
- [ ] Create pattern development guide
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Test complete workflow

## Success Criteria

1. **Flexibility**: Projects can choose their patterns
2. **Simplicity**: Clear base + plugins model
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new patterns
4. **Compatibility**: Works with existing CONSTRUCT structure
5. **Discovery**: Patterns can flow from projects back to CORE
6. **Integrity**: Projects cannot diverge by editing CLAUDE.md directly
7. **Validation**: Pre-commit hooks catch unauthorized modifications
8. **Traceability**: All customizations traced back to patterns.yaml or plugins

## Key Decisions

### What Changes from Original Plans

1. **CLAUDE.md is assembled, not symlinked**
   - Symlinks remain for CONSTRUCT tools and docs
   - CLAUDE.md is generated per project
   - **NEW**: Generated files are read-only with warning headers

2. **Pattern plugins are first-class citizens**
   - Not just documentation
   - Active part of project configuration
   - **NEW**: Project customizations via patterns.yaml, not direct edits

3. **LAB gets pattern development area**
   - Test patterns before promotion
   - Community can share experimental patterns
   - **NEW**: Clear workflow prevents manual CLAUDE.md edits

### What Stays the Same

1. **Template-first architecture** (from RESTRUCTURE-PLAN-04)
2. **Promotion system** (LAB → CORE)
3. **Symlinked CONSTRUCT directory**
4. **AI template structure**

### The "Don't Edit the Binary" Philosophy

Just as you wouldn't edit Photoshop's executable to change settings, you shouldn't edit CLAUDE.md directly:

- **Source Files**: CLAUDE-BASE.md, pattern plugins, patterns.yaml
- **Compiled Output**: CLAUDE.md (read-only, generated)
- **Customization**: Through configuration, not binary editing
- **Updates**: Regenerate from source, don't patch the output

## The Pattern Configuration Experience

When working in Claude Code:

```markdown
## 🎛️ Pattern Configuration

### Active Patterns (Toggle ✓/✗ to enable/disable)

#### Base Patterns (Always Active)
- ✓ Token-first development
- ✓ Error handling standards
- ✓ Documentation requirements

#### Language Patterns (Project: Swift + C#)
- ✓ swift-language - Swift/iOS development patterns
- ✓ csharp-language - C#/.NET patterns
- ✓ cross-platform/model-sync - Multi-language coordination

#### Architectural Patterns
- ✓ mvvm - Model-View-ViewModel architecture
- ✗ viper - VIPER architecture (alternative)
- ✗ clean-architecture - Clean Architecture pattern

#### Optional Patterns
- ✓ watch-patterns - Apple Watch specific
- ✗ construct-dev - CONSTRUCT development
- ✗ startup-velocity - Rapid prototyping

To change: Edit ✓/✗ above and say "reload patterns"

### Quick Context Commands
- "Enable CONSTRUCT development" - When you need to work on CONSTRUCT itself
- "Switch to API context" - Focus on C# backend patterns
- "Update User model everywhere" - I'll guide through all languages
```

## Multi-Language Project Example

When you say: "I need to add a profile picture to the User model"

Claude responds using multiple active patterns:

```
I'll help you add profile picture across your stack. Based on your active patterns (Swift + C# + cross-platform), here's what we need to update:

1. **C# Backend** (clean-architecture pattern):
   - Update User entity in Domain/Entities/User.cs
   - Add ProfilePictureUrl property
   - Create migration: Add-Migration AddUserProfilePicture
   
2. **API Layer**:
   - Update UserDto in Application/DTOs/UserDto.cs
   - Update API documentation/OpenAPI spec
   
3. **Swift iOS** (MVVM pattern):
   - Update User model in Models/User.swift
   - Add profilePictureURL to Codable properties
   - Update UserViewModel to handle image loading
   
4. **Database**:
   - Run migration on development database
   - Update seed data if needed

Would you like me to show the code for each layer?
```

This creates a truly context-aware system that understands your entire project stack while maintaining the flexibility to toggle patterns on and off as needed.

    *)
        echo "Usage: construct-patterns [regenerate|validate|show]"
        ;;
esac
```

#### 2.3 Create patterns.yaml Template
```yaml
# .construct/patterns.yaml
# Project-specific pattern configuration

# Languages used in this project
languages:
  - swift
  - csharp

# Active pattern plugins
plugins:
  - mvvm
  - cross-platform/model-sync
  - background-flash

# Project-specific rules (added to CLAUDE.md)
custom_rules:
  swift:
    - "Use 'Coordinator' suffix for navigation coordinators"
    - "Prefix private properties with underscore in ViewModels"
  csharp:
    - "Use 'Async' suffix for all async methods"
    - "Group related endpoints in partial controller classes"
  all:
    - "Add ticket number to TODO comments: // TODO (JIRA-123): Fix this"

# Pattern overrides (for exceptions to base rules)
overrides:
  - pattern: "mvvm/no-logic-in-views"
    exception: "Allow computed properties for pure UI calculations"
    scope: "swift"
```

#### 2.3 Update `create-project.sh`
```bash
# Add pattern selection to project creation
echo "What type of project is this?"
echo "1. iOS App (Swift)"

fi

# Assemble CLAUDE.md with selected patterns and languages
./assemble-claude.sh "$PROJECT_DIR" "$ALL_PLUGINS" --languages "$LANGUAGES"
```

### Phase 3: Implement Pattern Promotion & Validation

#### 3.1 Extend PROMOTE-TO-CORE.yaml
```yaml
# Existing file promotion
promotions:
  - type: file
    source: experiments/script.sh
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/script.sh
    
  # Pattern promotion
  - type: pattern
    source: patterns/plugins/new-pattern.md
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/new-pattern.md
    description: "Promotes tested pattern to stable"
    bump_version: minor
    
  # Project-specific pattern promotion
  - type: project-pattern
    source: ../RUN/patterns/custom-navigation.md
    dest: CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/custom-navigation.md
    description: "Promotes project discovery to reusable plugin"
    bump_version: minor
```

#### 3.2 Add Pre-commit Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit (or CONSTRUCT-CORE/hooks/pre-commit)

# Validate CLAUDE.md hasn't been manually edited
for project in $(find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -not -path "*/CONSTRUCT-*/*"); do
    project_dir=$(dirname "$project")
    
    echo "Validating $project..."
    if ! ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct-patterns.sh validate "$project_dir"; then
        echo "❌ Pre-commit check failed: CLAUDE.md has been manually edited"
        echo "📝 To fix: Update .construct/patterns.yaml and run:"
        echo "   construct-patterns regenerate"
        exit 1
    fi
done

echo "✅ All CLAUDE.md files are unmodified"
```

#### 3.3 Update promote-to-core.sh
```bash
# Add pattern promotion support
case "$type" in
  "file")
    # Existing logic
    ;;
  "pattern"|"project-pattern")
    # Validate pattern format
    if ! grep -q "^## \[" "$source"; then
        echo "❌ Pattern must start with ## [SCOPE] header"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Check for conflicts with existing patterns
    pattern_name=$(basename "$dest" .md)
    if grep -r "conflicts:.*$pattern_name" "$CONSTRUCT_CORE/patterns/"; then
        echo "⚠️  Pattern may conflict with existing patterns"
        read -p "Continue? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
        [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && exit 1
    fi
    
    # Copy pattern to CORE
    cp "$source" "$dest"
    echo "✅ Pattern promoted to CORE"
    ;;
esac
```

### Phase 4: Migration from Current State

#### 4.1 Extract Patterns from Existing Files
1. **From CONSTRUCT-LAB/CLAUDE.md**:
   - Shell scripting rules → `tooling/shell-scripting.md` plugin
   - Symlink management → `tooling/construct-dev.md` plugin  
   - Promotion workflow → `tooling/construct-dev.md` plugin

2. **From RUN/CLAUDE.md**:
   - Background flash prevention → `discoveries/background-flash.md` plugin
   - Watch-specific patterns → `discoveries/watch-patterns.md` plugin
   - Swift MVVM patterns → `architectural/mvvm.md` plugin
   - Swift language rules → `languages/swift.md` plugin

3. **Create Initial CLAUDE-BASE.md**:
   ```markdown
   # CONSTRUCT Base Patterns
   
   ## Universal Development Principles
   - Never break existing tests
   - Document why, not what
   - Token-first development
   - Error handling is mandatory
   
   ## Multi-Context Awareness
   This context system understands your entire project stack.
   Language-specific patterns are applied based on file types.
   Cross-platform patterns help coordinate changes across languages.
   
   ## Pattern System
   See active patterns below. Toggle ✓/✗ to change what rules I follow.
   Say "reload patterns" after making changes.
   ```

4. **Create Cross-Platform Plugin**:
   ```markdown
   # cross-platform/model-sync.md
   
   ## Cross-Platform Model Synchronization
   
   When updating data models, consider all representations:
   
   ### Model Change Checklist
   - [ ] Update backend model (C#/Python/etc.)
   - [ ] Update database schema/migration
   - [ ] Update API DTOs/contracts
   - [ ] Update frontend models (Swift/TypeScript/etc.)
   - [ ] Update API client code
   - [ ] Update tests across all platforms
   
   ### Common Patterns
   1. **Adding a field**: Propagates through entire stack
   2. **Renaming**: Requires API versioning consideration
   3. **Removing**: Check for breaking changes
   4. **Type changes**: Validate serialization compatibility
   ```

#### 4.2 Test Migration Path
```bash
# Test with RUN project
cd RUN
mv CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup

# Assemble new CLAUDE.md
../CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-CORE/CONSTRUCT/scripts/assemble-claude.sh . \
  "swift-mvvm,watch-patterns,background-flash"

# Verify all rules present
diff CLAUDE.md.backup CLAUDE.md
```

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates

#### 5.1 Update README.md
- Explain pattern system
- Show both workflows (templates vs local)
- Document pattern creation

#### 5.2 Create Pattern Guide
```markdown
# patterns/PATTERN-GUIDE.md

## Understanding the Pattern System

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Don't Edit CLAUDE.md Directly!

Think of CLAUDE.md like a compiled binary (e.g., Photoshop's .exe file). You wouldn't edit Photoshop's binary to change a setting - you'd use the preferences menu. Similarly:

- ❌ **NEVER** edit CLAUDE.md directly
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `.construct/patterns.yaml` for customizations
- ✅ **CREATE** new pattern plugins for reusable patterns

### Why CLAUDE.md is Read-Only

1. **It's Generated**: Like compiled code, it's built from source files
2. **Updates Overwrite**: When patterns update, your changes are lost
3. **No Version Control**: Git can't track what changed in generated files
4. **Team Confusion**: Others won't know about your local modifications

## Creating a Pattern Plugin

### For Project-Specific Rules
Edit `.construct/patterns.yaml`:
```yaml
custom_rules:
  swift:
    - "Use 'Coordinator' suffix for navigation"
    - "Prefix private properties with underscore"
```

### For Reusable Patterns
1. Create in LAB: `CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/plugins/your-pattern.md`
2. Test locally by adding to `.construct/patterns.yaml`
3. Promote to CORE using `promote-to-core.sh`
4. Now all projects can use it!

## Pattern Format
```markdown
## [SCOPE] Pattern Name

### When to Use
- Specific use cases
- Problem this solves

### Rules
- ✅ DO: Positive patterns
- ❌ DON'T: Anti-patterns

### Examples
\`\`\`swift
// Good example
\`\`\`

### Conflicts
- conflicts: [other-pattern]
- overrides: [base-rule]
```

## If You've Already Edited CLAUDE.md

1. **Save your changes**: Copy custom rules to a temporary file
2. **Update patterns.yaml**: Add your rules to `custom_rules`
3. **Regenerate**: Run `construct-patterns regenerate`
4. **Verify**: Check your rules appear in the new CLAUDE.md
5. **Commit**: Only commit `.construct/patterns.yaml`, not CLAUDE.md
```

   - **NEW**: Project customizations via patterns.yaml, not direct edits

3. **LAB gets pattern development area**
   - Test patterns before promotion
   - Community can share experimental patterns
   - **NEW**: Clear workflow prevents manual CLAUDE.md edits

### What Stays the Same

1. **Template-first architecture** (from RESTRUCTURE-PLAN-04)
2. **Promotion system** (LAB → CORE)
3. **Symlinked CONSTRUCT directory**
4. **AI template structure**

### The "Don't Edit the Binary" Philosophy

Just as you wouldn't edit Photoshop's executable to change settings, you shouldn't edit CLAUDE.md directly:

- **Source Files**: CLAUDE-BASE.md, pattern plugins, patterns.yaml
- **Compiled Output**: CLAUDE.md (read-only, generated)
- **Customization**: Through configuration, not binary editing
- **Updates**: Regenerate from source, don't patch the output

## The Pattern Configuration Experience

When working in Claude Code:

```markdown
## 🎛️ Pattern Configuration

### Active Patterns (Toggle ✓/✗ to enable/disable)

#### Base Patterns (Always Active)
- ✓ Token-first development
- ✓ Error handling standards
- ✓ Documentation requirements

#### Language Patterns (Project: Swift + C#)
- ✓ swift-language - Swift/iOS development patterns
- ✓ csharp-language - C#/.NET patterns
- ✓ cross-platform/model-sync - Multi-language coordination

#### Architectural Patterns
- ✓ mvvm - Model-View-ViewModel architecture
- ✗ viper - VIPER architecture (alternative)
- ✗ clean-architecture - Clean Architecture pattern

#### Optional Patterns
- ✓ watch-patterns - Apple Watch specific
- ✗ construct-dev - CONSTRUCT development
- ✗ startup-velocity - Rapid prototyping

To change: Edit ✓/✗ above and say "reload patterns"

### Quick Context Commands
- "Enable CONSTRUCT development" - When you need to work on CONSTRUCT itself
- "Switch to API context" - Focus on C# backend patterns
- "Update User model everywhere" - I'll guide through all languages
```

## Multi-Language Project Example

When you say: "I need to add a profile picture to the User model"

Claude responds using multiple active patterns:

```
I'll help you add profile picture across your stack. Based on your active patterns (Swift + C# + cross-platform), here's what we need to update:

1. **C# Backend** (clean-architecture pattern):
   - Update User entity in Domain/Entities/User.cs
   - Add ProfilePictureUrl property
   - Create migration: Add-Migration AddUserProfilePicture
   
2. **API Layer**:
   - Update UserDto in Application/DTOs/UserDto.cs
   - Update API documentation/OpenAPI spec
   
3. **Swift iOS** (MVVM pattern):
   - Update User model in Models/User.swift
   - Add profilePictureURL to Codable properties
   - Update UserViewModel to handle image loading
   
4. **Database**:
   - Run migration on development database
   - Update seed data if needed

Would you like me to show the code for each layer?
```

This creates a truly context-aware system that understands your entire project stack while maintaining the flexibility to toggle patterns on and off as needed.
