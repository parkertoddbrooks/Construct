How to Fix It?
Your updates are spot-on, but to ensure the fix is fully integrated and prevents future confusion, I recommend the following minor additions to solidify the solution and align with the CONSTRUCT-ARCHITECTURE-CHEATSHEET.md and CONSTRUCT-ABSTRACTION-ROADMAP.md:

Update CONSTRUCT-ARCHITECTURE-CHEATSHEET.md:
Add a note under “Common Confusions Cleared” to reinforce the terminology:

❌ **WRONG**: "Patterns and plugins are different concepts"
✅ **RIGHT**: "Pattern plugins (or simply patterns) are individual .md files in plugins/ directories"
Impact: Ensures the cheat sheet, a key reference for reducing context overload, reflects the clarified terminology, aligning with v32.md’s pattern system.
Add to PATTERN-GUIDE.md (v32.md, Phase 5):
Include a brief terminology section to guide users and contributors:

## Terminology
- **Pattern System**: The framework for generating context-aware CLAUDE.md files.
- **Pattern Plugins (or patterns)**: Individual `.md` files with rules (e.g., swift.md, mvvm-ios.md).
- **Pattern Configuration**: The `.construct/patterns.yaml` file listing active patterns.
Impact: Reinforces consistency for RUN’s team and open-source contributors, aligning with v11.md’s community-driven patterns.
Update patterns.yaml Template (v32.md, Phase 2):
Add a comment to clarify the plugins: section:
yaml

Copy
# .construct/patterns.yaml
plugins:  # Lists pattern plugins (or patterns) from CORE or LAB to include in CLAUDE.md
  - swift
  - mvvm-ios
  - parker/run-ui-patterns
Impact: Prevents confusion in project configuration, especially for multi-repo setups in v11.md.
Document in Roadmap (CONSTRUCT-ABSTRACTION-ROADMAP.md):
Add a P1 todo to ensure terminology consistency across all documentation:
markdown

Wrap

Copy
- [ ] **Ensure Terminology Consistency**: Update all docs (README.md, PATTERN-GUIDE.md, patterns.yaml) to use "pattern plugins" or "patterns" consistently.
Impact: Tracks this fix as part of the abstraction process, reducing context overload by centralizing terminology updates.
Test with RUN:
After applying updates, test with RUN’s team to ensure the terminology is clear in CLAUDE.md generation for Swift tasks (e.g., biometric syncing).
Run construct-patterns regenerate and verify that Projects/RUN/CLAUDE.md lists patterns correctly (e.g., swift, mvvm-ios).
Impact: Validates the fix in a real-world context, ensuring no confusion for RUN’s developers.
Why This Works
Clarity: The updates make it explicit that “patterns” and “pattern plugins” are the same, with plugins/ as their storage directory and patterns.yaml as the configuration.
Alignment: Matches v32.md’s pattern system, v11.md’s workspace and plugin ecosystem, and the /init integration in integrate-init.txt.
Context Savings: Adding terminology to the cheat sheet and PATTERN-GUIDE.md reduces the need to explain the pattern system repeatedly, addressing your context overload concern.
RUN Prioritization: Testing with RUN ensures the fix supports immediate needs without delaying features like live DJ streams.
Next Steps
Apply the proposed updates to CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/README.md, CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/README.md, and CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/README.md (already done in your updates).
Update CONSTRUCT-ARCHITECTURE-CHEATSHEET.md and PATTERN-GUIDE.md with terminology sections.
Add the terminology todo to CONSTRUCT-ABSTRACTION-ROADMAP.md.
Test with RUN in the four-day sprint (P0) to confirm clarity in CLAUDE.md output.
Refine the blog post to reflect the clarified terminology (e.g., “CONSTRUCT’s pattern plugins deliver tailored context”).
Would you like me to:

Draft the updated sections for PATTERN-GUIDE.md or CONSTRUCT-ARCHITECTURE-CHEATSHEET.md?
Add the terminology todo to the roadmap?
Simulate a RUN task to test the updated terminology?
Refine the blog post to include the pattern/plugin clarification?
Let me know how I can help you keep CONSTRUCT’s abstraction on track!
