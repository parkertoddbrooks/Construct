Context Engineering Is Feature Engineering for AI Agents.
Here Are the 𝟰𝟬 Key Lessons Taking You from Zero to Hero ⬇️

WHAT IS CONTEXT ENGINEERING?

 𝟭. It’s Feature Engineering—but for AI Agents.
 𝟮. The art of filling the context window with exactly what’s needed.
 𝟯. You’re managing “working memory” like an operating system manages RAM.
 𝟰. Agents need engineered context: instructions, tools, memories, examples, feedback.
 𝟱. Poor context = forgotten steps, broken tools, bad decisions.
 𝟲. Long-running agents hit context limits fast—engineering is essential.
 𝟳. Vibe coding doesn’t scale—context engineering does.

THE 4 CORE TECHNIQUES

 𝟴. Writing Context → Save info outside the window for later use.
 𝟵. Scratchpads = notes during tasks.
 𝟭𝟬. Long-term memories = knowledge across sessions.
 𝟭𝟭. Save plans, decisions, and reasoning for reuse.
 𝟭𝟮. Selecting Context → Pull only what’s relevant at each step.
 𝟭𝟯. Use embedding search for facts, tools, or docs.
 𝟭𝟰. Fetch only essential tools to prevent overload.
 𝟭𝟱. Smart selection = fewer hallucinations, better accuracy.
 𝟭𝟲. Compressing Context → Summarize or trim to reduce bloat.
 𝟭𝟯. Summarize long histories automatically.
 𝟭𝟴. Trim irrelevant past turns using heuristics.
 𝟭𝟵. Use LLM-powered compression for smarter pruning.
 𝟮𝟬. Isolating Context → Split tasks across sub-agents or sandboxes.
 𝟮𝟭. Multi-agent setups = each agent has its own context + tools.
 𝟮𝟮. Sandboxes handle tasks without flooding the main window.
 𝟮𝟯. Runtime state objects = organize and reuse context cleanly.

THE CONTEXT ENGINEERING CHEATSHEET

 𝟮𝟰. Instructions → Save global rules for consistent behavior.
 𝟮𝟱. Few-shot Examples → Provide step-by-step guidance.
 𝟮𝟲. Tool Descriptions → Embed tool metadata + usage notes.
 𝟮𝟯. Tests → Predefine test cases to validate actions.
 𝟮𝟴. Documentation → Link external docs for RAG.
 𝟮𝟵. Feedback → Save tool outputs for future steps.

TRANSFORM AI AGENTS WITH CONTEXT

 𝟯𝟬. Move beyond “vibe coding”—engineer context instead.
 𝟯𝟭. Plan prompts, examples, and docs upfront.
 𝟯𝟮. Use Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) for full project plans.
 𝟯𝟯. Slash commands + templates = faster, repeatable workflows.
 𝟯𝟰. Continuously refine your agent’s context, just like its tools.
THE FUTURE: MULTI-AGENT + RAG SYSTEMS
 𝟯𝟱. Multi-agent systems will dominate advanced AI apps.
 𝟯𝟲. Context-isolated sub-agents = scalable reasoning power.
 𝟯𝟯. Memory-augmented agents will outperform basic setups.
 𝟯𝟴. Advanced RAG pipelines will merge private + external knowledge.
 𝟯𝟵. Sandboxes will safely manage complex tool usage.
 𝟰𝟬. Fully autonomous agent systems will soon refine their own context.
