⏺ Yes! The scope is significant. Let's think about the pragmatic path forward:

  Implementation Reality Check

  Phase 1: Foundation (What You Have)

  - ✅ CONSTRUCT-LAB/CORE structure
  - ✅ Basic CLAUDE.md files
  - ✅ Symlink architecture
  - ✅ Shell scripts and workflows
  - ✅ PRDs documenting the vision

  Phase 2: Pattern System MVP

  Based on the unified-pattern-system-plan-v32.md:
  - Create pattern infrastructure directories
  - Build assemble-claude.sh script
  - Extract patterns from existing CLAUDE.md files
  - Test with RUN project
  - Basic patterns.yaml configuration

  Phase 3: RUN Import

  This is your proof of concept:
  - Import RUN using workspace-import-prd-v11.md workflow
  - Preserve git history
  - Set up multi-repo structure (if applicable)
  - Configure patterns for Swift/iOS
  - Test pattern system with real project

  Phase 4: Dynamic Context (Later)

  - Implement context orchestration
  - Command-based context switching
  - Performance optimization

  Practical Next Steps

  Week 1: Pattern System Core

  # Create the pattern structure
  mkdir -p CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/{languages,architectural,tooling}
  mkdir -p CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/plugins

  # Extract patterns from existing CLAUDE.md files
  # Start with Swift patterns from CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE.md

  Week 2: RUN Import

  # Import RUN as first real project
  ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/import-project.sh [RUN-repo-url] Projects/RUN

  # Configure patterns
  # Create Projects/RUN/.construct/patterns.yaml

  The Key: Start Simple

  1. Don't build everything at once
  2. RUN is your test case - make it work perfectly there
  3. Each success proves the concept
  4. Let patterns emerge naturally from RUN's needs

  What to Defer

  - Complex pattern inheritance
  - Dynamic context switching
  - Community features
  - Advanced conflict resolution

  The beauty of your design is that it can grow incrementally. Get RUN working with basic patterns first, then expand from
  there.
