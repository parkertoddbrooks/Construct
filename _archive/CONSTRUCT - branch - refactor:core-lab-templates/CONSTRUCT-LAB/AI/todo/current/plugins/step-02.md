 What's Been Completed ✅

  1. Pattern files created - All the .md pattern files have been created in the proper plugin structure
  2. Metadata yaml files created - Each plugin now has its .yaml metadata file
  3. Some validators migrated - A few validators have been moved to plugin directories (swift, python, csharp, etc.)
  4. Plugin directory structure exists - The patterns/plugins/[category]/[plugin-name]/ structure is in place

  What's Still Pending ❌

  1. Complete validator migration - Many validators are still in scripts-new/patterns/ instead of being bundled with their plugins:
    - construct-development validators
    - shell-scripting validators
    - shell-quality validators
    - ios-ui-library validators
    - mvvm-architecture validators
  2. Update core scripts - The scripts still look for validators in the old location (scripts-new/patterns/). They need to be updated to look
  in patterns/plugins/[category]/[plugin-name]/validators/
  3. Update documentation - Several docs need updating:
    - scripts-new/README.md (still mentions patterns/ directory)
    - CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/README.md (still references community/parker directories)
    - Missing CONSTRUCT-LAB/patterns/plugins/README.md
  4. Create pattern files for orphan validators - Some validators don't have corresponding .md pattern files yet
  5. Examples and tests - No plugins have examples/ or tests/ directories yet (these were marked as recommended in the PRD)

  Summary

  The plugin system structure has been partially implemented - the foundation is there (directories, pattern files, metadata) but the migration
   is incomplete. The key missing pieces are:
  1. Moving the remaining validators to their plugin directories
  2. Updating all scripts to look for validators in the new locations
  3. Updating documentation to reflect the new structure

  This aligns with what you found - that we're still using the old scripts directory and things aren't fully migrated yet.
