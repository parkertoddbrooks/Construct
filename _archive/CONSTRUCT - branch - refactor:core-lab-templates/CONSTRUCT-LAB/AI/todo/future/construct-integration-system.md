# CONSTRUCT Integration & Migration System

## Problem Statement

Real-world projects exist in various states of CONSTRUCT adoption:
- Projects with deprecated/old CONSTRUCT versions
- Projects with partial or broken CONSTRUCT implementation
- Projects with no CONSTRUCT at all
- Multiple projects needing standardization

Simply having templates for NEW projects isn't enough. We need a system to integrate, upgrade, and standardize CONSTRUCT across an existing portfolio of projects.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Project Analysis
Detect current CONSTRUCT state in any project:
- No CONSTRUCT present
- Old/deprecated version
- Partial implementation
- Modified/broken structure
- Current version

### 2. Integration Strategies
Different approaches based on project state:
- **Fresh Install**: Add CONSTRUCT to virgin project
- **Upgrade**: Update deprecated version to latest
- **Repair**: Fix broken implementations
- **Merge**: Combine custom modifications with standard
- **Selective Update**: Update only specific components

### 3. Safety Features
- Never break existing functionality
- Preserve custom modifications
- Backup before changes
- Dry-run mode
- Rollback capability

## Proposed Tools

### `analyze-project.sh`
```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/analyze-project.sh ../MyProject

# Output:
# CONSTRUCT Status: v1.2 (deprecated)
# AI Structure: Partial (missing dev-logs)
# Custom Modifications: Found in scripts/
# Recommendations: Upgrade with custom preservation
```

### `integrate-construct.sh`
```bash
# Full integration
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/integrate-construct.sh ../MyProject --mode=upgrade

# Selective updates
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/integrate-construct.sh ../MyProject --only=ai-structure

# Dry run
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/integrate-construct.sh ../MyProject --dry-run
```

### `diff-construct.sh`
```bash
# See what's different
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/diff-construct.sh ../MyProject

# Shows:
# - Missing files
# - Modified files
# - Extra files
# - Version differences
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Detection (MVP)
1. Build `analyze-project.sh` to detect:
   - CONSTRUCT version (from VERSION file)
   - Directory structure presence
   - File modifications (via checksums)
   - Custom additions

### Phase 2: Safe Integration
1. Create backup system
2. Build merge strategies:
   - Preserve custom files
   - Update standard files
   - Merge modified files (with conflicts)
3. Implement dry-run mode

### Phase 3: Selective Updates
1. Component-based updates:
   - Just AI structure
   - Just scripts
   - Just configs
2. Incremental adoption path

### Phase 4: Migration Patterns
1. Document common scenarios:
   - "I have v1, want v3"
   - "I modified scripts, want updates"
   - "I have multiple projects to standardize"
2. Create migration guides

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Old Project Upgrade
```bash
cd CONSTRUCT
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/analyze-project.sh ../OldSwiftApp
# Shows: CONSTRUCT v0.5, missing AI structure

./CONSTRUCT/scripts/integrate-construct.sh ../OldSwiftApp --upgrade --backup
# Upgrades to latest, preserves customizations
```

### Scenario 2: Broken CONSTRUCT Repair
```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/analyze-project.sh ../BrokenProject
# Shows: Partial CONSTRUCT, missing symlinks, modified structure

./CONSTRUCT/scripts/integrate-construct.sh ../BrokenProject --repair
# Fixes structure, restores symlinks, preserves custom work
```

### Scenario 3: Portfolio Standardization
```bash
# Analyze all projects
for project in ../MyProjects/*; do
  ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/analyze-project.sh "$project" >> construct-audit.txt
done

# Batch upgrade
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/batch-integrate.sh ../MyProjects/* --mode=standardize
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Real-world adoption** - Can integrate with existing codebases
2. **Gradual migration** - Don't need big-bang conversion
3. **Preserves investment** - Custom work isn't lost
4. **Reduces friction** - Easy to adopt in old projects
5. **Portfolio management** - Standardize many projects

## Success Criteria

- Can detect any CONSTRUCT state accurately
- Can upgrade without breaking existing code
- Can preserve customizations during upgrade
- Can work incrementally (component by component)
- Can handle edge cases safely

## Relationship to Template System

The template system creates NEW projects correctly.
The integration system fixes EXISTING projects.

Together they ensure:
- New projects start right (templates)
- Old projects can be upgraded (integration)
- All projects stay in sync (promotion system)

**Priority**: High (solves immediate real-world need)
**Complexity**: Medium (mostly analysis and careful file manipulation)
**Value**: Very High (enables CONSTRUCT adoption in existing codebases)
