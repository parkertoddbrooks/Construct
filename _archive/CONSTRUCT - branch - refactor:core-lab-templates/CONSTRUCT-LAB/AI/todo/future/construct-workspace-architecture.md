# CONSTRUCT Workspace Architecture - Multi-Project Development Ecosystem

## Vision
CONSTRUCT as a development workspace that contains and manages multiple related projects, with intelligent import and integration capabilities for existing projects.

## Architecture
```
CONSTRUCT/                          # Main workspace (git repo)
├── CONSTRUCT-CORE/                 # Stable tools
├── CONSTRUCT-LAB/                  # Development/improvements
├── Project-A-iOS/                  # Swift project (separate .git)
├── Project-B-Backend/              # C# API (separate .git)
├── Project-C-Web/                  # React app (separate .git)
└── Company-Shared/                 # Shared resources (separate .git)
```

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Project Management
- Single CONSTRUCT instance manages multiple projects
- Each project maintains its own git repository
- Language-agnostic through adapter system
- Shared tooling and standards across all projects

### 2. Intelligent Import System
When importing an existing project:

```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/import-project.sh https://github.com/user/existing-project

# CONSTRUCT detects:
# - Existing CONSTRUCT version (if any)
# - Custom modifications
# - Project structure
# - Language/framework
```

#### Import Process:
1. **Analyze existing CONSTRUCT** (if present)
   - Detect version from VERSION file
   - Identify custom scripts/modifications
   - Extract project-specific configurations

2. **Preserve customizations**
   - Move custom scripts to LAB/experiments/imported/
   - Document modifications in CLAUDE.md
   - Create migration notes

3. **Integrate into workspace**
   - Place project in CONSTRUCT workspace
   - Update CLAUDE.md with project context
   - Apply current CONSTRUCT tools
   - Preserve project's git history

### 3. CONSTRUCT Evolution Tracking

#### For projects with outdated CONSTRUCT:
```yaml
# Auto-generated during import
imported_construct_info:
  version: "0.5.2"
  custom_scripts:
    - custom-deploy.sh
    - special-validation.sh
  modifications:
    - Modified update-context.sh for custom paths
    - Added project-specific quality gates
  preserved_in: LAB/experiments/imported/project-name/
```

#### Integration into CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Imported Project Context
- Original CONSTRUCT version: 0.5.2
- Custom modifications preserved in: LAB/experiments/imported/
- Migration notes: [link to notes]
- Special requirements: [extracted from old CONSTRUCT]
```

### 4. Cross-Project Intelligence

The AI assistant understands:
- Relationships between projects
- Shared models/interfaces
- API contracts between services
- Common patterns across projects

Example:
```
"Update the User model in all projects after changing the C# API"
"Ensure the iOS app matches the new API endpoints"
"Apply the new logging pattern to all services"
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Multi-Project Structure
1. Update CONSTRUCT to support multiple project directories
2. Modify CLAUDE.md generation to handle multiple contexts
3. Create project registry system

### Phase 2: Import System
1. Build project analyzer
2. Create CONSTRUCT version detector
3. Implement customization preservation
4. Build integration workflow

### Phase 3: Cross-Project Features
1. Shared configuration management
2. Cross-project refactoring tools
3. Unified documentation generation
4. Multi-project quality gates

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Project dependency tracking
2. Automated cross-project testing
3. Shared component library
4. Multi-language adapter system

## Benefits

### For Development
- **No context switching** - All projects in one workspace
- **Shared improvements** - Fix once, apply everywhere
- **Preserve customizations** - Nothing lost during import
- **Evolution history** - Track how projects grew

### For Teams
- **Consistent standards** - Across all projects
- **Shared knowledge** - CLAUDE.md knows everything
- **Easy onboarding** - One workspace to understand
- **Flexible growth** - Add new projects/languages easily

### For Integration
- **Smart imports** - Understands existing CONSTRUCT
- **Customization preservation** - Respects project history
- **Gradual migration** - No big-bang changes needed
- **Knowledge retention** - Old patterns documented

## Use Cases

### 1. Import Existing Swift Project
```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/import-project.sh ~/old-projects/MyApp
# Detects CONSTRUCT 0.3, preserves customizations
# Updates to current CONSTRUCT while keeping special features
```

### 2. Start New Microservice
```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/create-project.sh UserService csharp-api
# Creates in workspace, inherits all standards
# Automatically integrated with other services
```

### 3. Add Frontend to Existing Backend
```bash
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/create-project.sh AdminDashboard react
# Knows about existing APIs
# Generates matching TypeScript interfaces
# Sets up proper connections
```

## Relationship to construct-integration-system.md

This builds on the integration system by:
- **Extending** single-project integration to multi-project workspaces
- **Preserving** all the safety features (backup, dry-run, etc.)
- **Adding** workspace-level intelligence
- **Enabling** cross-project operations

The integration system handles the "how" of importing/upgrading.
The workspace architecture defines the "where" and "why" of the overall structure.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can import projects with any CONSTRUCT version
- [ ] Preserves all customizations in accessible form
- [ ] Updates CLAUDE.md with complete context
- [ ] Supports multiple languages/frameworks
- [ ] Enables cross-project operations
- [ ] Maintains separate git repos
- [ ] Provides unified tooling

**Priority**: High (enables real-world usage patterns)
**Complexity**: High (but can be built incrementally)
**Value**: Extreme (transforms CONSTRUCT from tool to platform)
