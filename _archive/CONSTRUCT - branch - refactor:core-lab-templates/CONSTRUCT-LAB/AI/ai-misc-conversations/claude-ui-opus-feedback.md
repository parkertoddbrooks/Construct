This README is **significantly better** than the original "What is CONSTRUCT?" document! Here's why:

## What's Working Really Well

1. **Clear Problem/Solution Structure**
   - The "Problem with Current AI Development" section immediately resonates
   - Specific pain points that developers experience daily
   - Clear contrast between static approaches and living systems

2. **Concrete Examples**
   - The flow diagrams (`Template → Copy → Diverge → Drift`) are brilliant
   - The comparison table is immediately useful
   - Claude Code integration specifics show you understand the ecosystem

3. **Professional Tone**
   - No vague promises about future features
   - Focused on actual developer problems
   - Technical without being intimidating

4. **The "Living System" Concept**
   - This is your killer feature and it's well explained
   - The auto-updating context is a genuine innovation
   - Team knowledge sharing addresses a real pain point

## Suggestions for Enhancement

### 1. Add a Quick Example
Show the magic in 30 seconds:
```markdown
### See It In Action

```bash
# Your AI suggests a new ViewModel
# CONSTRUCT automatically detects it and updates context:

> "Added UserProfileViewModel to component inventory.
> Updated CLAUDE.md with new MVVM patterns.
> Your next AI session will know about this component."
```
```

### 2. Clarify the Setup
The `[Installation instructions coming soon]` is fine for now, but add:
```markdown
### What You Get Today
- Complete Swift project template with CONSTRUCT pre-integrated
- Working AI context management system
- Architecture validation scripts
- Team workflow documentation
```

### 3. Address the "How"
Add a brief technical overview:
```markdown
### Under the Hood
CONSTRUCT uses git hooks and shell scripts to:
- Monitor code changes in real-time
- Extract architectural patterns
- Update AI context files automatically
- Validate against team standards
```

### 4. Stronger Call-to-Action
Replace generic support section with:
```markdown
## Get Started

1. **Use the Template**: [Create your first CONSTRUCT project](https://github.com/parkertoddbrooks/CONSTRUCT/generate)
2. **Watch the Demo**: [5-minute walkthrough video](#)
3. **Join the Discussion**: Share your AI development challenges

*CONSTRUCT is in active development. Star the repo to follow updates.*
```

## Key Differentiators You're Nailing

1. **"Living" vs "Static"** - This distinction is crystal clear
2. **Team-centric** - Not just individual developer productivity
3. **AI-native** - Built for the Claude Code/Cursor era
4. **Practical** - Solves real problems developers face today

## Missing Pieces to Consider

1. **Security/Privacy** - Brief note about what data stays local vs shared
2. **Performance Impact** - Does this slow down development?
3. **Migration Path** - Can existing projects adopt CONSTRUCT?

This README positions CONSTRUCT as a **development philosophy** rather than just another tool, which is exactly right. It's addressing the messy reality of AI-assisted development that no one else is tackling systematically.
