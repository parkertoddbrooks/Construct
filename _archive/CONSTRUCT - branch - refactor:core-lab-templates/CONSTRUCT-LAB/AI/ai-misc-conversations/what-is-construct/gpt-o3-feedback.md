Feedback on “What is CONSTRUCT?” Draft

1. High-Level Impressions
	•	Compelling concept & hook. The “Homebrew for iOS development—but smarter” analogy lands well and frames the value proposition quickly.
	•	Clear present vs future split. Separating what exists today from the roadmap helps readers trust that you’re not over-promising.
	•	Call-to-action is actionable. The quick-start commands make the project feel usable right away.

2. Strengths to Keep

Area	Why it Works
Problem framing	Highlights integration pain points every iOS dev recognizes.
Vision graphics	ASCII boxes give a fast architectural snapshot without overwhelming visuals.
Open-source stance	MIT license + privacy assurances anticipate typical objections.
Dual-interface examples	Shows non-tech PMs and devs how each persona benefits.

3. Clarifications & Gaps

Section	Feedback
“Living CLAUDE.md”	Briefly define what lives there & why the name; outside readers won’t know.
MCP acronym	Spell out on first use and add a one-sentence definition.
Opt-in analytics flow	A short diagram or step list would reassure privacy-minded teams.
Roadmap dates	Consider adding lightweight quarter targets (e.g., “Q3 2025”) so readers can gauge pace.
Design token enforcement	Mention whether you align with existing systems (e.g., Figma tokens) or a bespoke spec.

4. Technical Depth Suggestions
	1.	Concrete integration example.  Replace the generic intercom example with a real snippet showing generated files & commit diff—makes the “90%” claim tangible.
	2.	Error-handling stance.  How does construct add roll back on failure? A brief note prevents “magic black-box” concerns.
	3.	Extensibility.  Outline how third parties can contribute new integration recipes (api, manifest format, review process).
	4.	CI/CD fit.  Call out whether the CLI is deterministic and safe for non-interactive environments.

5. Tone & Flow
	•	Trim superlatives. Words like “truly intelligent,” “perfect,” and “zero-knowledge” read as marketing; swapping for measured claims boosts credibility.
	•	Shorten repeated content. The “Today vs Tomorrow” benefits are listed twice; consolidating reduces length without losing emphasis.
	•	Edge-case disclaimers. A footnote on limitations (e.g., closed-source SDKs) demonstrates honesty.

6. Open Questions for the Team
	1.	How will licensing work for integrations that have their own TOS or usage caps?
	2.	Is community opt-in limited to public GitHub, or will self-hosted Git services be supported?
	3.	Do you envision IDE plug-ins (Xcode source extensions) or will CONSTRUCT remain CLI-only?
	4.	How is architectural drift detected across SwiftUI-heavy codebases where patterns are less explicit?

7. Recommended Next Steps
	1.	Add a real-world case study.  One paragraph: “Acme Co shaved 12 hrs integrating Firebase.”
	2.	Publish a minimal demo repo.  3-file example to let readers inspect generated scaffolding before adopting.
	3.	Insert a security & privacy FAQ.  Five bullets covering data sent, storage, deletion.
	4.	Create a ‘How to Contribute Patterns’ doc.  Lowers barrier for early community momentum.
