 Now I fully understand the architecture! Let me summarize:

  Complete Understanding of CONSTRUCT Architecture:

  1. CORE (Minimal & Universal)

  - Contains only essential, universal patterns and tools
  - Symlinked to LAB and projects for stability
  - Changes only through formal promotion from LAB
  - The "sacred" stable foundation

  2. LAB (Innovation & Plugin Ecosystem)

  - Development environment for CONSTRUCT itself
  - NEW: Permanent home for pattern plugins (parker/, community/, etc.)
  - Where you experiment and test new features
  - Where you install and maintain external patterns/plugins

  3. Projects (Using CONSTRUCT)

  - Get AI/ directory copied from templates
  - Get CONSTRUCT symlink to CORE
  - Get .construct/patterns.yaml configuration
  - Can use patterns from both CORE and LAB plugins

  The Evolution:

  Originally, LAB was just for developing features to promote to CORE. Now it's ALSO:
  - A plugin ecosystem (like npm for patterns)
  - Where developers maintain their own specialized patterns
  - No promotion needed - LAB is the permanent home for these plugins

  Why Symlinks Matter:

  1. CONSTRUCT symlink → Points to CORE for stable tools
  2. AI documentation symlinks → Single source of truth for docs
  3. Stability → Updates to CORE automatically available everywhere
  4. Plugin access → Projects can reference LAB plugins without copying

  Current Situation:

  - LAB acts as both CONSTRUCT's development environment AND an example project
  - Scripts write to LAB's AI/ directory when developing CONSTRUCT
  - When a real project is created, scripts write to that project's AI/ directory
  - Pattern plugins live permanently in LAB, not promoted to CORE

  This is a brilliant architecture - CORE stays minimal and stable, while LAB provides both development space AND a plugin ecosystem for specialized
  patterns!
