ok, questions, so we made all these changes to lab, how do they get pushed to core? and how do we track they are out sync?

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Test workflow in new structure and update remaining scripts                     
     ☒ Answer Parker's questions about the new architecture
     ☒ Design GitHub integration for CORE/LAB/TEMPLATES workflow
     ☒ Test all CONSTRUCT scripts to verify they work in new structure
     ☒ Update update-architecture.sh to better reflect CORE/LAB/TEMPLATES structure
     ☒ Archive old session-states, dev-updates, and quality reports keeping only last 3
     ☐ Update construct-setup script for new template location
     ☐ Test template creation workflow
     ☐ Fix check-architecture.sh to work with new TEMPLATES structure
     ☐ Fix check-quality.sh integer expression errors

⏺ Great question! Here's how changes flow from LAB to CORE:

  Current Situation:

  - We updated scripts in CONSTRUCT-CORE directly (like update-architecture.sh)
  - LAB uses CORE via symlink, so LAB immediately sees changes
  - But we haven't established the promotion workflow yet!

  The Proper Flow Should Be:

  1. Make Changes in LAB First
  # Work in LAB, not CORE
  cd CONSTRUCT-LAB/experiments/
  vim new-feature.sh
  # Test thoroughly
  2. Promote to CORE When Stable
  # Create promotion script
  ./promote-to-core.sh experiments/new-feature.sh
  # This copies to CORE and bumps version
  3. Track Sync Status
  # Check if LAB has uncommitted experiments
  ./check-lab-core-sync.sh

  # Output:
  # ⚠️ LAB has 3 modified files not in CORE:
  #    - experiments/better-validation.sh
  #    - experiments/multi-lang-detect.sh
  #    - lib/new-patterns.sh

  What We Need to Build:

  1. Version Tracking
    - CORE has VERSION file (1.0.0)
    - LAB tracks which CORE version it's based on
    - Know when they diverge
  2. Promotion Scripts
  CONSTRUCT-LAB/tools/
  ├── promote-to-core.sh      # Promote stable features
  ├── check-sync.sh           # Check LAB/CORE differences
  └── rollback-from-core.sh   # If something breaks
  3. Git Integration
    - CORE changes = new version tag
    - Changelog tracks what moved from LAB
    - Clear commit messages

  Would you like me to create these sync/promotion tools?

> ah! so if we want to update: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-CORE/scripts/update-context.sh
   - this is done as a copy in experiments.. then moveed to CORE.

⏺ YES! Exactly! You've got it!

  The workflow is:

  1. Never edit CORE directly (what we just did was wrong!)
  2. Copy to LAB experiments first
  cd CONSTRUCT-LAB/experiments/
  cp ../CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh ./update-context-improved.sh
  # Edit and test here
  vim update-context-improved.sh
  3. Test in LAB
  # Run from experiments
  ./update-context-improved.sh
  # Make sure it works!
  4. When ready, promote to CORE
  ./tools/promote-to-core.sh experiments/update-context-improved.sh scripts/update-context.sh
  # This would:
  # - Copy to CONSTRUCT-CORE/scripts/update-context.sh
  # - Bump CONSTRUCT-CORE/VERSION
  # - Create changelog entry
  5. LAB immediately gets update (via symlink)
  # Now everyone using CORE gets the improvement
  ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh  # New version!

  This is exactly like kernel development:
  - LAB = linux-next (experimental)
  - CORE = stable kernel (production)
  - Never break CORE!

  Want me to create the promotion tools so we can work this way going forward?
