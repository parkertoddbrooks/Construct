## What We Discovered

### Technical Insights
- Development workflow improvements implemented
- System stability maintained through incremental changes
- Automated validation systems operational

### Performance Impact
- Build processes: All scripts executing successfully
- Quality checks: All validation gates passing
- Documentation: Auto-generation working correctly

## Risk & Impact Assessment

### What Could Break
- Dependencies on modified files may need validation
- Changes to core scripts could affect development workflow
- Documentation updates may require review for accuracy

### Technical Debt Incurred
- Incremental changes may accumulate complexity over time
- Automated systems may need periodic review and optimization

### Dependencies & Blockers
- All development tools operational
- No immediate blockers identified
- Workflow dependencies resolved

## Quality & Testing

### Code Review Focus Areas
- Recent script modifications and their impact
- Library function usage and sourcing
- Error handling and validation patterns

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ All CONSTRUCT scripts validated and functional
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks executing successfully
- ✅ Quality gates operational

### Known Issues
- Minor warnings in configuration validation (PyYAML dependency)
- Documentation coverage could be enhanced
- Test coverage needs improvement

## Implementation Details

### Recent Changes
fix: Resolve script path error and update documentation

### Architecture Patterns
```bash
# Standard CONSTRUCT workflow
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-architecture.sh
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-quality.sh
```

## Forward Planning
