# Dev Update - Development Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-03
**Session Duration**: Recent development activity
**Branch**: refactor/core-lab-templates

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Goals
- [x] Continue CONSTRUCT development improvements
- [x] Maintain architecture and quality standards
- [x] Update automated systems and documentation

## ðŸ“‹ What I Did

### Recent Development Activity
- test: Fix pre-commit hook dev update path (48 minutes ago)
- refactor: Major code deduplication and library function improvements (53 minutes ago)
- fix: Reorganize automated files into proper directories (4 hours ago)
- docs: Add CONSTRUCT workspace architecture and fix documentation check (5 hours ago)
- fix: Update documentation check to look for files in new todo/future location (22 hours ago)

### Technical Implementation

- Executed automated quality checks and validations
- Updated development context and documentation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions
- **Decision**: Incremental improvements to CONSTRUCT development workflow
  - **Rationale**: Maintain stability while enhancing functionality
  - **Alternatives**: Major refactoring (deferred for system stability)

### Code Patterns Established
```bash
# CONSTRUCT development pattern
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-architecture.sh
```

### Problems Solved
1. **Problem**: Various development workflow improvements needed
   - **Solution**: Incremental fixes and automated validations
   - **Learning**: Small, consistent improvements maintain system stability

## ðŸ“Š Metrics
- Files changed:      110
- Recent commits: 5
- Quality checks: All passing
- Architecture compliance: Maintained

## ðŸš€ What's Next
- [ ] Continue CONSTRUCT development enhancements
- [ ] Maintain documentation and context accuracy
- [ ] Ensure all automated processes function correctly

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings
- Incremental improvements are effective for CONSTRUCT development
- Automated systems help maintain development consistency
- Regular context updates keep development focused and efficient
