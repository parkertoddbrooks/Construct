## üîß CONSTRUCT Development Context

### Active Development Areas


### Key CONSTRUCT Scripts Status
- **update-context.sh**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **check-architecture.sh**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **before_coding.sh**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Template Status
‚ùå Templates directory missing

## üöÄ Next CONSTRUCT Development Session

### Immediate Priorities
1. Continue dual development environment implementation
2. Complete missing template components
3. Implement USER-project-files script integration
4. Test template repository workflow

### Development Workflow Commands
```bash
# CONSTRUCT Development Environment
cd CONSTRUCT-LAB/
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh      # Update development context
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-architecture.sh  # Validate CONSTRUCT architecture
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/before_coding.sh xyz   # Search existing before creating

# Cross-Environment Analysis (when ready)
./CONSTRUCT/scripts/analyze-user-project.sh # Analyze USER-project-files patterns
```

### Key Files for Next Session
- **CONSTRUCT Context**: CONSTRUCT-LAB/AI/CLAUDE.md
- **Development Status**: Auto-generated section shows current state
- **Active PRDs**: construct-template-repository-prd.md
- **Implementation Plan**: implement-dual-dev-environments.md

## üí° Recent CONSTRUCT Insights
- Dual development environments working (shell vs Swift domains)
- Auto-updating context successful for CONSTRUCT development
- Architecture validation finds real issues in CONSTRUCT itself
- Recursive improvement: CONSTRUCT improving itself with its own tools

## ü§ñ For Claude Context Transfer
This session focused on implementing dual development environments for CONSTRUCT. The system now has parallel AI-assisted workflows for both CONSTRUCT development (shell/Python) and user projects (Swift). Key achievement: CONSTRUCT can now improve itself using its own methodology.
