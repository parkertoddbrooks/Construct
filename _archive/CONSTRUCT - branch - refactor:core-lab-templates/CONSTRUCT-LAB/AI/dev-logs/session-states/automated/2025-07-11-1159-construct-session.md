## üöÄ Next Development Session

### Detected Next Steps
1. Continue CONSTRUCT system development
2. Enhance pattern-based architecture
3. Improve project-aware scripts
4. Test multi-project support

### Development Workflow Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT

# Update context and validate
# Review project documentation
# Update CLAUDE.md or README.md
# Run project-specific commands
```

### Key Files for Next Session
- **Project Context**: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/CLAUDE.md
- **Documentation**: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-LAB/AI/docs/
- **Patterns Config**: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/.construct/patterns.yaml
- **Recent Changes**: Review git log and uncommitted files

## üí° Recent Insights
- Pattern-based architecture enables flexible project support
- Scripts now work with any project directory
- Context-aware behavior based on .construct/patterns.yaml
- Recursive improvement: CONSTRUCT improving itself

## ü§ñ For Claude Context Transfer
This session focused on making CONSTRUCT scripts project-aware. Scripts now accept PROJECT_DIR parameters and work with any project structure, not just CONSTRUCT itself. Pattern-based behavior allows scripts to adapt to different project types.
