# Swift + Claude Starter Template PRD Info

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-28

I've created a comprehensive PRD for your open-source Swift + Claude starter template!
This PRD outlines:

## Key Highlights:

### üéØ Core Concept

- A Swift project template that starts with MVVM, design tokens, and the **5-Layer Defense System** built-in (including PRD-driven development)
- Fork it and you're immediately building with best practices enforced
- Claude understands the codebase from day one with AI Architectural Guidance

### üèóÔ∏è What's Included

1. **Pre-built MVVM architecture** with example features
2. **Design token system** for responsive UI
3. **5-Layer Defense System** preventing architecture drift:
   - Layer 0: PRD-driven development
   - Layer 1: Smart documentation (CLAUDE.md)
   - Layer 2: Pre-coding guidance
   - Layer 3: Architecture enforcement
   - Layer 4: Continuous monitoring
4. **Claude integration** with enhanced CLAUDE.md including:
   - AI Architectural Guidance section
   - Clear MVVM boundaries
   - Common AI mistakes to avoid
5. **Swift 6 patterns** enforced:
   - @MainActor for all ViewModels
   - Modern async/await patterns
   - Proper @State usage rules
6. **Accessibility enforcement**:
   - Dynamic Type support
   - VoiceOver optimization
   - WCAG compliance checks
7. **SwiftUI quality standards** with visual bug prevention
8. **Testing foundation** with examples
9. **Development tools** and scripts:
   - check-quality.sh (11 comprehensive checks)
   - check-accessibility.sh
   - Session summary automation at 90% context
10. **Multi-AI platform support** (Cursor, Copilot, Claude)
11. **Dynamic rule export** from living project state
12. **Zero dependencies** - pure Swift

### üöÄ Unique Value

- **Self-enforcing architecture** - can't write bad code:
  - Pre-commit hooks with clear AI-friendly messages
  - MVVM violations caught immediately
  - Swift 6 patterns enforced
- **AI-first development** - Works with ALL AI tools:
  - Enhanced AI understanding with anti-pattern examples
  - Clear architectural boundaries
  - "Where code belongs" quick reference
- **Production-ready** - not just another demo:
  - Professional DAW-quality standards
  - Background flash prevention patterns
  - Real-world feature examples
- **Living documentation** - always current:
  - Auto-updating CLAUDE.md sections
  - Pattern library extracted from actual code
  - Active violations tracked
- **Session continuity** - Automated context preservation at 90% limit:
  - Claude alerts user when context is full
  - Seamless handoffs between sessions
- **No manual context files** - Everything automated
- **Dynamic rules** - Export project-aware rules for any AI platform
- **Better than static .cursorrules** - Includes your actual patterns and decisions
- **Modern Swift 6 ready** - Future-proof from day one
- **Accessibility built-in** - Professional UI quality enforced

### üìã Implementation Plan

- **5-week development cycle**
- **Phased approach**:
  - Week 1-2: Core template with MVVM examples
  - Week 3: 5-Layer Defense System integration
  - Week 4: Swift 6 patterns and accessibility
  - Week 5: Documentation and launch prep
- **Clear success metrics**:
  - 1,000 GitHub stars in 6 months
  - Zero architecture violations in projects using template
  - 90% reduction in setup time
- **Open source strategy**:
  - MIT License
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Video tutorials
  - Active community support

### üí° Why This Matters

This would be a game-changer for Swift developers! Instead of starting from scratch or
copying bits from old projects, they'd have a professional foundation with:

- **Architecture that enforces itself** through git hooks and checks
- **AI that understands the patterns** and won't suggest anti-patterns
- **Examples of real features** (login, settings, data lists)
- **Tools that maintain quality** automatically
- **Swift 6 patterns** from the start
- **Accessibility** as a first-class citizen

### üé¨ Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Create a more detailed technical specification?
2. Start outlining the actual template structure?
3. Design the GitHub repository layout?
4. Create the first example feature?

### üåü Impact

This could really help the Swift community:
- **Beginners** start with best practices
- **Experienced devs** save setup time
- **Teams** maintain consistency
- **AI tools** work better with clear patterns

The combination of enforced architecture + AI understanding + modern patterns makes this unique in the Swift ecosystem!
