# PRD: Claude Code Hooks Integration for CONSTRUCT Dual-Environment System

**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Status**: Future Enhancement  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 sprints)

## Problem Statement

CONSTRUCT's dual-environment development system (CONSTRUCT-dev + Swift app templates) currently relies on manual execution of quality gates and context updates. While the existing shell scripts provide comprehensive validation, they can be bypassed or forgotten, leading to:

- Architecture violations that slip through
- Outdated AI context during development sessions
- Inconsistent enforcement of development standards
- Manual overhead for developers

## Solution Overview

Integrate Claude Code hooks into both CONSTRUCT development environments to create an **automatically enforced, AI-aware development workflow** that makes quality gates impossible to bypass when using Claude Code.

## Core Value Proposition

Transform CONSTRUCT from "AI-assisted development with manual quality gates" to "AI-enforced development with automatic quality gates" - making architectural compliance effortless and deterministic.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **CONSTRUCT Template Users**: Developers building Swift apps using CONSTRUCT templates
- **CONSTRUCT Contributors**: Developers improving CONSTRUCT itself

### Secondary Users  
- **Enterprise Teams**: Organizations wanting enforced coding standards
- **AI Development Advocates**: Teams showcasing AI-integrated workflows

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **100% Hook Execution Rate**: All configured hooks execute without bypass
- **Context Freshness**: CLAUDE.md always reflects current project state
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: 0% architecture violations in Claude Code sessions

### User Experience Metrics
- **Reduced Manual Commands**: 80% reduction in manual script execution
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers productive in first session
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on automatic quality enforcement

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. CONSTRUCT Development Environment Hooks

**Location**: `CONSTRUCT-dev/.claude-code/hooks.json`

#### Startup Hooks
```json
{
  "startup": [
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-context.sh",
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-architecture.sh --summary"
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Ensure CONSTRUCT development context is current and compliant

#### Pre-Edit Hooks  
```json
{
  "pre_edit": [
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/check-quality.sh --file=$FILE",
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/validate-template-integrity.sh"
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Prevent architecture violations before they're written

#### Post-Bash Hooks
```json
{
  "post_bash": [
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/scan_construct_structure.sh --quiet",
    "./CONSTRUCT/scripts/update-architecture.sh --incremental"
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Keep documentation current after system changes

### 2. Swift App Development Environment Hooks

**Location**: `PROJECT-TEMPLATE/USER-CHOSEN-NAME/.claude-code/hooks.json`

#### Startup Hooks
```json
{
  "startup": [
    "./AI/scripts/update-context.sh",
    "./AI/scripts/check-architecture.sh --swift-focus"
  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Load Swift MVVM context and validate current state

#### Pre-Edit Hooks (Swift Files)
```json
{
  "pre_edit": {
    "pattern": "*.swift",
    "commands": [
      "./AI/scripts/validate-mvvm-patterns.sh --file=$FILE",
      "./AI/scripts/check-design-tokens.sh --file=$FILE"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Purpose**: Enforce MVVM patterns and design token usage

#### Post-Build Hooks
```json
{
  "post_bash": {
    "pattern": "xcodebuild*",
    "commands": [
      "./AI/scripts/analyze-build-output.sh",
      "./AI/scripts/update-component-inventory.sh"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Purpose**: Analyze build results and update AI context

### 3. Hook Configuration Management

#### Dynamic Hook Loading
- Hooks adapt based on current directory context
- CONSTRUCT-dev/ automatically loads shell development hooks
- Swift project directories load MVVM enforcement hooks

#### Hook Inheritance
- Base hooks defined at template level
- Project-specific overrides in local configuration
- User preferences override project defaults

#### Conditional Execution
- Hooks respect `--dry-run` flags for testing
- Development vs. production hook profiles
- Graceful degradation when scripts unavailable

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Hook Infrastructure
**Duration**: 1 sprint

1. **Create Hook Configuration Templates**

   ```bash
   # Automatic hook installation during setup
   ./construct-setup
   > Installing Claude Code hooks...
   > ‚úÖ CONSTRUCT development hooks configured
   > ‚úÖ Swift development hooks configured
   ```

2. **First Claude Code Session**
   ```
   Claude Code starting...
   üîÑ Running startup hooks...
   ‚úÖ Context updated (15 components, 0 violations)
   ‚úÖ Architecture validated
   
   Ready for development! Your AI context is current.
   ```

3. **Real-time Validation**
   ```
   [User edits Swift file]
   üîç Validating MVVM patterns...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Hook warning: Business logic detected in View
   üí° Suggestion: Move logic to ViewModel
   
   Continue with edit? (y/n)
   ```

### Error Handling and Recovery

- **Graceful Degradation**: If hooks fail, development continues with warnings
- **Hook Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting hook issues
- **Quick Fixes**: Automatic suggestions for common hook failures

## Risk Assessment
