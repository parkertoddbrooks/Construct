 Current Status Summary

  Based on the PRDs, here's where we are:

  âœ… Phase 1: Audit & Planning - COMPLETED

  - Audited all CLAUDE.md files
  - Documented which files to keep/delete
  - Designed two-stage process

  âœ… Phase 2: Create Enhancement System - COMPLETED

  - Created init-construct.sh with intelligent merging
  - Implemented injection protocol
  - Added pattern-enhanced header warning
  - Tested two-stage flow with /init

  âœ… Phase 3: Extract CONSTRUCT Development Patterns - COMPLETED

  - Created construct-dev plugin with injections:
    - guidelines.md (includes symlink rules, etc.)
    - examples.md (shell script patterns)
    - commands.md (CONSTRUCT commands)
    - ai-guidance.md (AI assistance patterns)
    - validated-discoveries.md (empirical truths)

  âœ… Phase 4: Extract iOS/Swift Patterns - COMPLETED

  - Moved iOS/Swift content to existing pattern plugins:
    - Performance â†’ frameworks/swiftui/injections/performance.md
    - Visual quality â†’ frameworks/swiftui/injections/visual-quality.md
    - Accessibility â†’ platforms/ios/injections/accessibility.md
  - Created RUN-specific backup in Projects/RUN/patterns/

  ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Enhance CLAUDE-BASE.md - PARTIALLY DONE

  - Added {{CONSTRUCT:CURRENT-STRUCTURE}} injection point
  - Still need to review if CLAUDE-BASE.md needs more enhancement

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps According to Roadmap:

  1. Phase 6: Update All Scripts
    - Update create-project.sh to use two-stage init
    - Update import-project.sh for two-stage init
    - Update workspace-update.sh to regenerate CLAUDE.md files
  2. Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
    - Test with CONSTRUCT itself
    - Test with existing projects
    - Create migration guide
  3. Phase 8: Release & Migration
    - Create migration tools
    - Update documentation
    - Announce changes

  We're about 80% complete with the abstraction roadmap. The core functionality is working, but we need to update the peripheral scripts and do
  comprehensive testing.

   Excellent! The commit was successful and all pre-commit hooks ran. Let me create a summary of what we've accomplished:

  Summary of Work Completed

  Phase 6 Started: Enhanced init-construct.sh âœ…

  We've successfully implemented the smart init-construct functionality with three clear operating modes:

  Mode 1: First-time CONSTRUCT User (No patterns.yaml)

  - âœ… Analyzes project structure to detect languages, frameworks, platforms
  - âœ… Uses plugin registry to show available options
  - âœ… Interactive plugin selection with recommendations
  - âœ… Non-interactive support via piped input
  - âœ… Creates patterns.yaml based on selections

  Mode 2: Existing CONSTRUCT User (patterns.yaml exists)

  - âœ… Already worked with --regenerate flag
  - âœ… Uses existing patterns to enhance CLAUDE.md
  - âœ… Preserves all /init content

  Mode 3: Legacy CLAUDE.md Migration

  - âœ… Detects non-/init CLAUDE.md files
  - âœ… Extracts custom patterns to LAB plugins
  - âœ… Creates project-specific plugin with injections
  - âœ… Backs up original as CLAUDE.md.pre-construct
  - âœ… Includes extracted plugin in patterns.yaml

  Key Features Implemented:

  1. Interactive Scripts Support
    - Follows the --show-prompts pattern
    - Works seamlessly with Claude Code constraints
    - Shows what inputs are needed before execution
  2. Smart Project Analysis
    - Detects Swift, Python, TypeScript, Rust
    - Identifies frameworks like SwiftUI, React
    - Recognizes platforms like iOS
  3. Registry Integration
    - Loads plugin registry for discovery
    - Shows plugin descriptions when available
    - Falls back to directory scanning if yq not installed
  4. Pattern Extraction
    - Parses legacy CLAUDE.md for custom rules
    - Creates LAB plugins automatically
    - Preserves all custom content during migration

  Next Steps:

  1. Test the three modes with real projects
  2. Update workspace scripts (create-project.sh, import-project.sh) to use two-stage init
  3. Create migration guide for existing users
  4. Document the new workflow in user-facing docs

  The implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the enhancement spec and integrates seamlessly with CONSTRUCT's pattern system!
