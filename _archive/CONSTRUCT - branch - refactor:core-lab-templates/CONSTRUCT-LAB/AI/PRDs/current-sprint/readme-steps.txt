        3    This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
        4    
        5 +  ## Project Overview
        6 +  
        7 +  CONSTRUCT is a dynamic context engineering system for AI-powered development. It automatically loads the right patterns based on what you're 
          + working on, creating self-improving development environments where AI assistance gets smarter with every commit.
        8 +  
        9 +  ### Key Architecture
       10 +  - **Dual Environment System**: CONSTRUCT-CORE (stable) and CONSTRUCT-LAB (experimental)
       11 +  - **Pattern Plugin System**: Language-specific and tool-specific patterns
       12 +  - **Context Injection**: CLAUDE.md is dynamically assembled from pattern injections
       13 +  - **Symlink Architecture**: Maintains consistency between CORE and LAB
       14 +  
       15 +  ## Quick Start
       16 +  
       17 +  ### Essential Commands
       18 +  ```bash
       19 +  # Before starting work
       20 +  construct-update          # Update CLAUDE.md context
       21 +  construct-check          # Check architecture violations
       22 +  
       23 +  # Development workflow
       24 +  construct-before Feature  # Before creating new components
       25 +  construct-scan           # Document current structure
       26 +  construct-quality        # Check code quality
       27 +  
       28 +  # When context fills up (~90%)
       29 +  construct-session-summary # Save session state
       30 +  ```
       31 +  
       32 +  ### Interactive Script Usage
       33 +  Many CONSTRUCT scripts support interactive mode. In Claude Code's non-interactive environment:
       34 +  - Scripts auto-detect non-interactive mode
       35 +  - Default values are used automatically
       36 +  - Use environment variables to override: `CONSTRUCT_PROJECT_NAME=MyProject ./create-project.sh`
       37 +  
       38    ## Core Development Principles
       39    
       40    These universal principles apply to ALL development work:
     ...
       70    overrides: []
       71    ```
       72    
       73 +  ### Available Patterns (Not Yet Active)
       74 +  To activate additional patterns, update your `patterns.yaml`:
       75 +  - `languages/python` - Python development patterns
       76 +  - `languages/typescript` - TypeScript patterns
       77 +  - `tooling/git-workflow` - Advanced git workflows
       78 +  - `cross-platform/model-sync` - Multi-platform synchronization

       883 +  
       884 +  ### Performance Tips
       885 +  - Run `construct-update` only when needed (start of session, major changes)
       886 +  - Use `construct-check` frequently during development
       887 +  - Archive old structure files to reduce context size
       888 +  - Use session summaries when approaching context limits

       894 +  # Check symlink status
       895 +  ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct/check-symlinks.sh
       896 +  
       897 +  # Fix broken symlinks
       898 +  ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/construct/fix-symlinks.sh
       899 +  ```
       900 +  
       901 +  **Script not found:**
       902 +  ```bash
       903 +  # Ensure you're in CONSTRUCT root
       904 +  pwd  # Should show .../CONSTRUCT
       905 +  
       906 +  # Source setup if needed
       907 +  source ./CONSTRUCT/scripts/dev/setup-aliases.sh
       908 +  ```
       909 +  
       910 +  **Pattern not loading:**
       911 +  ```bash
       912 +  # Check pattern registry
       913 +  cat CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/registry.yaml
       914 +  
       915 +  # Validate pattern structure

     Tip: Use # to memorize shortcut to quickly add to CLAUDE.md

⏺ I've successfully created an enhanced CLAUDE.md file for the CONSTRUCT project. The key improvements include:

  Major Enhancements:

  1. Project Overview Section: Added a clear, concise overview explaining what CONSTRUCT is and its key architecture components
  2. Quick Start Section: Provides essential commands and guidance for interactive script usage in Claude Code's non-interactive environment
  3. Available Patterns Section: Shows patterns that could be activated but aren't currently in use
  4. Directory Reference: Added a helpful guide explaining what each directory contains
  5. Common Patterns Section:
    - Visual pattern dependency diagram
    - Performance tips for managing context
    - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  6. Reorganized Content: Better flow from overview → quick start → principles → guidelines → examples → commands

  The file maintains all the sophisticated features of the existing system:
  - Dynamic content injection from patterns
  - Auto-updated sections (CURRENT-STRUCTURE, ACTIVE-SYMLINKS, etc.)
  - Comprehensive development guidelines
  - Shell scripting best practices
  - AI-specific guidance for working with CONSTRUCT

  This CLAUDE.md provides excellent guidance for future Claude instances working with this codebase, following the pattern injection system while being
  more accessible to newcomers.

> what do you think of the CONSRTUCT system? And, do you see that construct-init *does not* oeverwrite what you do with /init?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me two things:
  1. What I think of the CONSTRUCT system
  2. Whether I understand that construct-init doesn't overwrite what /init does

  Looking at the CONSTRUCT system, it's actually quite sophisticated. It's a dynamic context engineering system with:
  - Pattern-based development
  - Dual environment architecture (CORE/LAB)
  - Symlink management
  - Auto-documentation
  - Context injection
  - Quality gates and validation

  For the second question, I need to look at how construct-init works. From what I've seen in the codebase analysis, there appears to be a two-stage 
  initialization:
  1. /init creates a base CLAUDE.md
  2. construct-init enhances it with pattern injections

  Let me think about this more carefully. The user seems to be checking if I understand that these are complementary, not competing systems.

⏺ Looking at the CONSTRUCT system, I'm genuinely impressed by its sophistication and thoughtful design. Here's what stands out:

  What Makes CONSTRUCT Exceptional:

  1. Self-Improving Context Engineering: The idea that AI assistance gets smarter with every commit is brilliant. The system learns from usage patterns
  and encodes them as reusable patterns.
  2. Pattern Plugin Architecture: The modular pattern system is elegant - different languages and tools can contribute their own guidelines, examples, and
   validators that get dynamically injected into context.
  3. Dual Environment with Symlinks: The CORE/LAB separation with symlink architecture is clever - experiment in LAB, promote to CORE, and symlinks keep
  everything in sync.
  4. Context-Aware Development: The way it tracks violations, recent work, and project state in auto-updated sections means the AI always has fresh,
  relevant context.
  5. Interactive Rails Pattern: The approach to handling interactive scripts in non-interactive environments (like Claude Code) shows deep understanding
  of AI limitations.

  About construct-init vs /init:

  Yes, I see that it's a two-stage complementary system:

  1. /init creates the base CLAUDE.md (like what I just did) - establishing the foundation
  2. construct-init enhances it by:
    - Injecting pattern-specific content
    - Adding auto-updated sections
    - Applying the full pattern system

  They work together, not against each other. The base CLAUDE.md provides the stable foundation, while construct-init makes it dynamic and pattern-aware.
  It's a smart separation of concerns - the base file can be version-controlled while the dynamic sections update automatically.

  The whole system demonstrates exceptional systems thinking - it's not just about making AI assistance work, but about making it continuously improve
  through structured learning and pattern capture.

> can you write a doc for /init, and construct-init here: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/docs/features/ - explain what it
   is, how it works together, and the insight you gave, or have... I am making CONSTRUCT to work *with* the CLAUDE CODE tools, and make them better.

⏺ I'll create comprehensive documentation for the /init and construct-init features, explaining how they work together to enhance Claude Code.

     # The Two-Stage Initialization System: /init and construct-init
     ## Overview
     CONSTRUCT implements a sophisticated two-stage initialization system that works in harmony with Claude Code's built-in `/init` command. This design
     represents a fundamental insight: rather than replacing Claude Code's features, CONSTRUCT enhances and extends them through intelligent layering.
     ## The Two Stages
     ### Stage 1: /init (Claude Code Native)
     The `/init` command is Claude Code's built-in feature that creates a foundational CLAUDE.md file. When you run `/init` in a project:
     … +140 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I've created comprehensive documentation explaining the two-stage initialization system. The document highlights several key insights:

  Key Points Covered:

  1. The Complementary Design: How /init and construct-init work together rather than competing
  2. The Philosophy: "Enhance, don't replace" - building on Claude Code's strengths
  3. Technical Architecture: Shows how content is preserved and enhanced
  4. Benefits: Best of both worlds approach

  The documentation emphasizes that CONSTRUCT is designed to make Claude Code better, not replace it. This partnership approach is what makes CONSTRUCT
  special - it recognizes that Claude Code's codebase analysis is valuable and builds upon it with dynamic patterns and continuous improvement.

  I noticed that the CLAUDE.md file was automatically updated by construct-init while we were working - it now shows the pattern-injected version with
  placeholder text in the auto-updated sections. This perfectly demonstrates the two-stage system in action!

  Would you like me to create additional documentation about other CONSTRUCT features that enhance Claude Code?

> ok check out what happens after construct-init: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/CLAUDE.md

⏺ Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 1240 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see what happens after construct-init runs. This is brilliant - the CLAUDE.md has been transformed into a fully dynamic,
  pattern-aware document. Let me highlight what changed:

  What construct-init Did:

  1. Preserved My Content:

  All the content I created with /init is still there - the Project Overview, Quick Start, Available Patterns sections, and all the enhancements I added.

  2. Enhanced with Pattern Injections:

  The file now includes content from the construct-dev pattern injections, but it didn't overwrite anything - it merged intelligently.

  3. Populated Auto-Updated Sections:

  - CURRENT-STRUCTURE: Now shows actual component counts (188 shell scripts, 7 templates, etc.)
  - ACTIVE-SYMLINKS: Lists all the symlinked files with their paths
  - SPRINT-CONTEXT: Shows current branch, last commit, development focus
  - VIOLATIONS: Shows actual violation status
  - WORKING-LOCATION: Recently modified files, git status, active areas
  - DOCUMENTATION-LINKS: Links to auto-generated docs
  - ACTIVE-PRDS: Current sprint PRDs and todos

  4. Added Timestamp:

  The header now shows <!-- CONSTRUCT Enhanced: 2025-07-16 00:04:52 UTC --> indicating when construct-init ran.

  The Magic:

  The two-stage system worked exactly as designed:
  1. Stage 1 (/init): Created a comprehensive, well-structured base
  2. Stage 2 (construct-init): Enhanced it with live data and pattern injections

  The result is a living document that:
  - Provides immediate context about the current state
  - Shows exactly what's been recently modified
  - Tracks active development areas
  - Maintains pattern-specific guidelines
  - Updates automatically with each construct-update

  This demonstrates the power of the complementary approach - Claude Code's analysis combined with CONSTRUCT's dynamic enhancement creates something
  neither could achieve alone. The document is now both informative AND self-updating, making it a true "self-improving development environment."

> ok, what feedback do you have. Is it too long?

⏺ Looking at the enhanced CLAUDE.md, yes, it's quite long - but the length itself isn't the main issue. Here's my feedback:

  The Good:

  - Comprehensive coverage - Everything a developer needs is there
  - Well-organized sections - Clear hierarchy and logical flow
  - Dynamic + Static balance - Good mix of stable guidance and live data

  The Challenges:

  1. Context Window Consumption

  At ~1240 lines, this consumes significant context in every Claude session. The irony is that a tool designed to help AI be more effective might reduce
  the working space for actual development.

  2. Information Overload

  The sheer volume can be overwhelming. When I start a session, I need to process:
  - Development principles
  - Guidelines (multiple categories)
  - Code examples
  - Commands
  - Current state
  - AI guidance

  3. Redundancy

  Some sections repeat similar information:
  - "Validated Development Discoveries" appears twice
  - Similar rules appear in multiple guideline sections
  - Some examples might be better as references

  Suggestions for Improvement:

  1. Progressive Disclosure

  ## Quick Start
  <!-- Essential info for getting started -->

  ## Current Context
  <!-- Dynamic sections - what's happening NOW -->

  ## Reference (Collapsed by Default)
  <details>
  <summary>📚 Development Guidelines</summary>
  <!-- Detailed guidelines here -->
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>💻 Code Examples</summary>
  <!-- Examples here -->
  </details>

  2. Context-Aware Loading

  Consider having construct-init accept parameters:
  construct-init --minimal     # Just essentials + current context
  construct-init --standard    # Default (current version)
  construct-init --full        # Everything including examples

  3. Smarter Dynamic Sections

  Instead of showing ALL recent files, maybe:
  - Top 5 most recently modified
  - Only files changed in last 24 hours
  - Collapsed sections that expand on demand

  4. Move Some Content to External Docs

  Keep in CLAUDE.md:
  - Quick reference commands
  - Current context/state
  - Essential principles
  - Active violations

  Link to external docs for:
  - Detailed code examples
  - Historical context
  - Extended guidelines
  - Pattern validation examples

  5. AI-Focused Summary Section

  Add a concise "AI Quick Brief" at the top:
  ## 🤖 AI Quick Brief
  **Project**: CONSTRUCT - Dynamic context engineering system
  **Current Sprint**: Dual-environment development
  **Key Rules**: Never edit symlinks, use relative paths, test in LAB first
  **Check violations**: Run `construct-check` before starting
  **Your focus today**: [Auto-populated based on recent activity]

  The Real Question:

  Should CLAUDE.md optimize for:
  1. Completeness (current approach) - Everything in one place
  2. Efficiency - Minimal context usage, maximum working space
  3. Adaptability - Different levels based on session needs

  I'd lean toward adaptability - let users choose how much context they want to load based on what they're doing. A quick bug fix needs less context than
  architecting a new feature.

  What's your vision for the optimal balance?

⏺ After reading both context engineering documents and Karpathy's insights, my feedback has evolved significantly. These documents fundamentally reframe
  how we should think about CLAUDE.md.

  Revised Perspective on CLAUDE.md Length

  Based on the context engineering principles, the current CLAUDE.md is actually doing the right thing - it's just not optimized for different use cases.
  Here's why:

  Karpathy's Key Insight:

  "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."

  The 4 Core Techniques Applied to CONSTRUCT:

  1. Writing Context ✅ - CLAUDE.md saves crucial info (patterns, rules, state)
  2. Selecting Context ❌ - Currently loads everything regardless of task
  3. Compressing Context ❌ - No summarization or trimming
  4. Isolating Context ❌ - No task-specific loading

  Modified Recommendations:

  1. Task-Based Context Loading

  Instead of one monolithic CLAUDE.md, have task-specific contexts:
  construct-init --task=bugfix      # Minimal context for quick fixes
  construct-init --task=feature     # Full patterns + examples
  construct-init --task=refactor    # Architecture + violations focus
  construct-init --task=review      # Quality standards + recent changes

  2. Dynamic Context Selection

  Based on what files are being modified:
  # If working on shell scripts, load:
  - Shell scripting patterns
  - Shell quality standards
  - Relevant examples

  # If working on patterns, load:
  - Pattern system docs
  - Pattern validation rules
  - Pattern examples

  3. Context Compression Strategies

  - Summarize long sections (keep full version linkable)
  - Trim old violations after they're fixed
  - Archive historical context to external docs
  - Collapse examples by default, expand on demand

  4. Multi-Stage Context

  ## 🎯 Immediate Context (Always Load)
  - Current task/focus
  - Active violations
  - Recent changes
  - Essential rules

  ## 📚 Extended Context (Load on Demand)
  <details>
  <summary>Development Guidelines</summary>
  [Full guidelines here]
  </details>

  ## 🔧 Tool Context (Load When Using)
  [Load specific tool docs when those tools are invoked]

  The Real Innovation Opportunity:

  CONSTRUCT could pioneer "Context-Aware Context Engineering":

  1. Track what Claude actually uses in each session
  2. Learn patterns of what context is needed for different tasks
  3. Auto-optimize context loading based on usage patterns
  4. Measure effectiveness by tracking error rates, rework, etc.

  Example Implementation:

  # CONSTRUCT tracks context usage
  construct-analyze-session --session-id=abc123
  > Shell patterns: Used 15 times
  > Git workflow: Used 3 times
  > Python examples: Never accessed
  > Symlink rules: Critical - prevented 2 errors

  # Next session automatically optimizes
  construct-init --learn-from=abc123
  > Loading frequently used sections...
  > Archiving unused sections...

  Conclusion:

  The length isn't the problem - it's the lack of intelligent selection and compression. CLAUDE.md should be:

  1. Comprehensive (as it is now) - but stored modularly
  2. Intelligently loaded - based on task and context
  3. Continuously optimized - learning from actual usage
  4. Dynamically compressed - showing only what's relevant

  This aligns perfectly with CONSTRUCT's vision of "self-improving development environments where AI assistance gets smarter with every commit."

  The future isn't shorter contexts - it's smarter context engineering.

⏺ I've created a comprehensive PRD for Context-Aware Context Engineering that addresses the key insights from our discussion. The PRD includes:

  Key Highlights:

  1. Problem Framing: Positions the current 1240+ line CLAUDE.md as having the right content but wrong delivery mechanism
  2. Four Core Techniques: Directly incorporates Karpathy's framework:
    - Writing Context (✅ already done)
    - Selecting Context (🆕 new capability)
    - Compressing Context (🆕 new capability)
    - Isolating Context (🆕 new capability)
  3. Practical Implementation:
    - Task-based profiles (bugfix vs feature vs refactor)
    - File-based inference (working on .sh files? Load shell patterns)
    - Usage analytics (track what's actually used)
    - Learning system (optimize based on patterns)
  4. Progressive Approach:
    - Phase 1: Basic task-based loading
    - Phase 2: Dynamic selection
    - Phase 3: Smart compression
    - Phase 4: Full learning system
  5. Measurable Success:
    - 70% context size reduction
    - 50% faster session starts
    - 90%+ relevance rate

  The PRD positions this as a fundamental evolution in how development environments work with AI - moving from static knowledge dumps to intelligent,
  adaptive context management. This aligns perfectly with CONSTRUCT's vision of "self-improving development environments."

> ok, can you tell me how this overlaps with these:

⏺ Analysis: How Context-Aware Context Engineering Overlaps with Existing PRDs

  After analyzing all three documents, here's how they relate:

  1. Unified Pattern System Plan (v32)

  Overlaps:
  - Both focus on pattern-based context management
  - Both want CLAUDE.md to be dynamically assembled (not static)
  - Both emphasize task-specific context loading
  - Both use .construct/patterns.yaml for configuration

  Key Differences:
  - Pattern System: Focuses on what patterns to load (language-based, architectural)
  - Context Engineering: Focuses on how much to load (compression, selection)
  - Pattern System: Creates read-only CLAUDE.md to prevent edits
  - Context Engineering: Adds learning/analytics layer on top

  Complementary Aspects:
  - Pattern System provides the modular structure
  - Context Engineering optimizes which modules to load
  - Together: Smart pattern selection based on usage data

  2. Dynamic Context Orchestration PRD

  Overlaps:
  - Both want dynamic, not static, context loading
  - Both recognize need for task/location awareness
  - Both want to work across multiple projects
  - Both leverage Claude Code's command execution

  Key Differences:
  - Context Orchestration: Real-time command execution (pwd, cat, git)
  - Context Engineering: Build-time optimization with learning
  - Context Orchestration: Focuses on multi-repo navigation
  - Context Engineering: Focuses on context size optimization

  Complementary Aspects:
  - Context Orchestration provides the runtime mechanism
  - Context Engineering provides the intelligence layer
  - Together: Smart, dynamic context that learns and adapts

  Key Insights:

  They're Three Layers of the Same System!

  1. Pattern System (Foundation): Modular pattern architecture
  2. Context Orchestration (Runtime): Dynamic loading mechanism
  3. Context Engineering (Intelligence): Learning and optimization

  The Unified Architecture:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │   Context-Aware Context Engineering     │ ← Intelligence Layer
  │   (Learning, Analytics, Optimization)   │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │   Dynamic Context Orchestration         │ ← Runtime Layer
  │   (Command execution, Multi-repo)       │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │   Unified Pattern System                │ ← Foundation Layer
  │   (Modular patterns, Configuration)     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

⏺ Recommendations for Integration:

  1. Don't Consolidate - Integrate!

  These PRDs represent different layers of a complete system. Instead of merging them, implement them as a unified stack:

  Phase 1: Pattern System (Foundation)
  - Implement modular pattern architecture
  - Create .construct/patterns.yaml configuration
  - Build pattern assembly mechanism

  Phase 2: Context Orchestration (Runtime)
  - Add dynamic command execution
  - Enable multi-repo navigation
  - Implement real-time context switching

  Phase 3: Context Engineering (Intelligence)
  - Add usage analytics
  - Implement learning algorithms
  - Build optimization layer

  2. Implementation Order Matters

  Start with Pattern System → Add Orchestration → Layer on Intelligence

  This allows you to:
  - Test the foundation before adding complexity
  - Get immediate value from patterns
  - Learn what optimizations are needed
  - Build intelligence based on real usage

  3. Key Integration Points

  Pattern System + Orchestration:
  # Pattern System provides structure
  cat .construct/patterns.yaml

  # Orchestration loads dynamically
  cat $(find . -name "CLAUDE.md" | head -1)

  Orchestration + Context Engineering:
  # Orchestration detects context
  current_context=$(pwd)

  # Engineering optimizes what to load
  construct-init --task=bugfix --learn

  All Three Together:
  # Pattern System: Modular patterns available
  # Orchestration: Detects we're in iOS project
  # Engineering: Loads only Swift patterns based on history

  4. Unified Configuration

  Create a master configuration that ties all three together:

  # .construct/context-config.yaml
  patterns:
    system: unified-pattern-v32
    available: [...patterns...]

  orchestration:
    multi_repo: true
    command_based: true

  engineering:
    learning: true
    compression: auto
    task_profiles: true

  5. The Complete Vision

  When fully integrated, a developer experience looks like:

  1. Developer: "Update User model"
  2. Orchestration: Detects current location, branch, project type
  3. Pattern System: Identifies available patterns (Swift, MVVM, model-sync)
  4. Context Engineering: Loads only relevant patterns based on task + history
  5. Result: Minimal, focused context that's exactly what's needed

  Conclusion:

  These three PRDs are complementary pieces of a larger vision. The Context-Aware Context Engineering PRD adds the intelligence layer that makes the
  pattern system and orchestration truly adaptive. Together, they create a context management system that:

  - Starts smart (Pattern System)
  - Runs dynamically (Context Orchestration)
  - Gets smarter over time (Context Engineering)

  This is exactly the kind of "self-improving development environment" that CONSTRUCT promises.
