> hi how are you?

⏺ I'm doing well, thank you! Ready to help with any development tasks you have in mind. How can I assist you today?

> what is called when you have built in tests that run to test ui flows after you make changes to code?

⏺ That's called end-to-end (E2E) testing or UI automation testing.

  These tests simulate real user interactions with your application's UI to verify complete workflows function correctly after code
  changes. Common tools include Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, and Puppeteer.

> but what abourt for CONSRUCT? the app only does a handful of things that are all defined. What I want to do is do all those things 
  systematically but not with AI, but the AI fix after.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Identify all CONSTRUCT core operations/commands           
     ☐ Create systematic test script for all CONSTRUCT operations
     ☐ Implement smoke test that exercises all functionality
     ☐ Add error capture and reporting for AI to fix

⏺ That's called a smoke test or regression test suite.

  For CONSTRUCT, you want a script that exercises all the core operations systematically - like creating projects, importing, pattern
  management, promotion workflow, etc. Then when something breaks, AI can analyze the failures and fix them.

  Would you like me to create this systematic test script for CONSTRUCT?

> but, I want it for not just CONSTRCUT if possible. like can it be available to the projects aided by CONSTRUCT  regardless of 
  architechture

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Design universal smoke test framework as CONSTRUCT pattern/plugin   
     ☐ Create pattern that projects can configure with their own operations
     ☐ Build test runner that captures failures for AI analysis
     ☐ Make it work across different architectures (web, mobile, CLI)

⏺ Yes! That would be a universal smoke test pattern - a CONSTRUCT plugin that any project can configure.

⏺ Task(Search for existing test patterns)
  ⎿  Done (16 tool uses · 31.5k tokens · 1m 56.0s)                                                                                       

⏺ Perfect timing! CONSTRUCT has quality validation but no actual test patterns yet. Let me create a universal smoke test plugin:

         1 +  # Smoke Tests Pattern
         2 +  
         3 +  A universal smoke test framework that systematically exercises all critical paths in your application, capturing failures for 
           + AI-assisted fixing.
         4 +  
         5 +  ## Overview
         6 +  
         7 +  Smoke tests are lightweight, high-level tests that verify your application's core functionality works after changes. This pattern 
           + provides a framework for defining and running smoke tests across any architecture.
         8 +  
         9 +  ## Configuration
        10 +  
        11 +  ```yaml
        12 +  # .construct/smoke-tests.yaml
        13 +  version: "1.0"
        14 +  name: "MyApp Smoke Tests"
        15 +  
        16 +  # Define your app's critical operations
        17 +  operations:
        18 +    - name: "user-signup"
        19 +      description: "User registration flow"
        20 +      type: "ui-flow"
        21 +      steps:
        22 +        - action: "navigate"
        23 +          target: "/signup"
        24 +        - action: "fill"
        25 +          target: "#email"
        26 +          value: "test@example.com"

        43 +      type: "system"
        44 +      steps:
        45 +        - action: "execute"
        46 +          command: "npm run db:ping"
        47 +        - action: "verify-output"
        48 +          contains: "connected"
        49 +  
        50 +  # Error capture for AI analysis
        51 +  error_capture:
        52 +    screenshots: true
        53 +    logs: true
        54 +    stack_traces: true
        55 +    system_state: true
        56 +    
        57 +  # Reporting
        58 +  reporting:
        59 +    format: "markdown"

        62 +  ```
        63 +  
        64 +  ## Usage
        65 +  
        66 +  ### Running Smoke Tests
        67 +  
        68 +  ```bash
        69 +  # Run all smoke tests
        70 +  construct-smoke-test run
        71 +  
        72 +  # Run specific operation
        73 +  construct-smoke-test run user-signup
        74 +  
        75 +  # Dry run to validate configuration
        76 +  construct-smoke-test validate
        77 +  
        78 +  # Generate AI fix report
        79 +  construct-smoke-test report --ai-friendly
        80 +  ```
        81 +  
        82 +  ### Test Types
        83 +  
        84 +  #### UI Flow Tests
        85 +  For web/mobile applications with user interfaces:
        86 +  ```yaml
        87 +  type: "ui-flow"
        88 +  steps:
        89 +    - action: "navigate|click|fill|select|verify|wait"
        90 +      target: "css-selector|xpath|id"
        91 +      value: "optional-value"
        92 +  ```
        93 +  
        94 +  #### API Tests
        95 +  For REST/GraphQL endpoints:
        96 +  ```yaml
        97 +  type: "api"
        98 +  steps:
        99 +    - action: "GET|POST|PUT|DELETE"
       100 +      target: "endpoint-path"
       101 +      headers: { optional }
       102 +      body: { optional }
       103 +    - action: "verify-status|verify-response"
       104 +      value: "expected-value"
       105 +  ```
       106 +  
       107 +  #### System Tests
       108 +  For CLI tools, scripts, or system operations:
       109 +  ```yaml
       110 +  type: "system"
       111 +  steps:
       112 +    - action: "execute"
       113 +      command: "shell-command"
       114 +      timeout: 30
       115 +    - action: "verify-output|verify-exit-code"
       116 +      value: "expected"
       117 +  ```
       118 +  
       119 +  #### Custom Tests
       120 +  For framework-specific operations:
       121 +  ```yaml
       122 +  type: "custom"
       123 +  runner: "path/to/custom-runner.js"
       124 +  steps:
       125 +    - action: "custom-action"
       126 +      params: { any: "value" }
       127 +  ```
       128 +  
       129 +  ## Implementation
       130 +  
       131 +  ### Test Runner Architecture
       132 +  
       133 +  ```bash
       134 +  construct-smoke-test/
       135 +  ├── runners/

       148 +  ```
       149 +  
       150 +  ### Error Capture Format
       151 +  
       152 +  When tests fail, capture comprehensive context:
       153 +  
       154 +  ```markdown
       155 +  ## Smoke Test Failure Report
       156 +  
       157 +  **Test**: user-signup
       158 +  **Step**: 3 - click #submit
       159 +  **Failure**: Element not found
       160 +  
       161 +  ### Error Context
       162 +  - **Screenshot**: [failure-user-signup-step3.png]
       163 +  - **Console Logs**: 
       164 +    ```
       165 +    ERROR: Cannot read property 'submit' of null
       166 +    ```
       167 +  - **Network**: Last 5 requests captured
       168 +  - **DOM State**: Page structure at failure
       169 +  
       170 +  ### AI Fix Instructions
       171 +  To fix this issue:
       172 +  1. The submit button selector may have changed
       173 +  2. Check if the form structure was modified
       174 +  3. Verify the element exists before clicking
       175 +  
       176 +  ### Suggested Fix
       177 +  ```javascript
       178 +  // Current step:
       179 +  { action: "click", target: "#submit" }
       180 +  
       181 +  // Suggested fix:
       182 +  { action: "click", target: "button[type='submit']" }
       183 +  ```
       184 +  ```
       185 +  
       186 +  ## Best Practices
       187 +  
       188 +  ### 1. Keep Tests Lightweight
       189 +  - Focus on critical paths only
       190 +  - Each operation < 30 seconds
       191 +  - Total suite < 5 minutes
       192 +  
       193 +  ### 2. Make Tests Deterministic
       194 +  - Use test data fixtures
       195 +  - Mock external dependencies
       196 +  - Reset state between tests
       197 +  
       198 +  ### 3. Design for AI Fixing
       199 +  - Capture maximum context on failure
       200 +  - Include fix suggestions
       201 +  - Structure errors for pattern recognition
       202 +  
       203 +  ### 4. Version Your Tests
       204 +  - Track smoke test changes in git
       205 +  - Update tests with features
       206 +  - Document breaking changes
       207 +  
       208 +  ## Integration
       209 +  
       210 +  ### CI/CD Pipeline
       211 +  ```yaml
       212 +  # .github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml
       213 +  name: Smoke Tests
       214 +  on: [push, pull_request]
       215 +  jobs:
       216 +    smoke:
       217 +      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       218 +      steps:
       219 +        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       220 +        - run: npm install
       221 +        - run: construct-smoke-test run
       222 +        - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
       223 +          if: failure()
       224 +          with:
       225 +            name: smoke-test-failures
       226 +            path: .construct/smoke-test-reports/
       227 +  ```
       228 +  
       229 +  ### Pre-commit Hook
       230 +  ```bash
       231 +  #!/bin/bash
       232 +  # .git/hooks/pre-commit
       233 +  construct-smoke-test run --quick || {
       234 +    echo "Smoke tests failed! Run 'construct-smoke-test report' for details"
       235 +    exit 1
       236 +  }
       237 +  ```
       238 +  
       239 +  ### AI Integration
       240 +  ```bash
       241 +  # When smoke tests fail
       242 +  construct-smoke-test report --ai-friendly > failure-report.md
       243 +  
       244 +  # Feed to AI for analysis
       245 +  ai-fix analyze failure-report.md
       246 +  
       247 +  # AI can then use CONSTRUCT patterns to fix issues
       248 +  ```
       249 +  
       250 +  ## Architecture Support
       251 +  
       252 +  ### Web Applications
       253 +  - Uses Playwright for cross-browser testing
       254 +  - Supports SPA and traditional apps
       255 +  - Mobile responsive testing
       256 +  
       257 +  ### Mobile Apps

       269 +  - Authentication handling
       270 +  - Response validation
       271 +  
       272 +  ## Customization
       273 +  
       274 +  ### Custom Runners
       275 +  Create custom runners for specific frameworks:
       276 +  
       277 +  ```javascript
       278 +  // .construct/smoke-runners/my-framework.js
       279 +  module.exports = {
       280 +    name: 'my-framework',
       281 +    
       282 +    async setup(config) {
       283 +      // Initialize your framework
       284 +    },
       285 +    
       286 +    async execute(step) {
       287 +      // Execute custom action
       288 +      switch (step.action) {
       289 +        case 'my-action':
       290 +          return await myFramework.do(step.params);
       291 +      }
       292 +    },
       293 +    
       294 +    async teardown() {
       295 +      // Cleanup
       296 +    }
       297 +  };
       298 +  ```
       299 +  
       300 +  ### Custom Validators
       301 +  Add domain-specific validations:
       302 +  
       303 +  ```yaml
       304 +  validators:
       305 +    - type: "custom"
       306 +      name: "check-accessibility"
       307 +      runner: ".construct/validators/a11y.js"
       308 +  ```
       309 +  
       310 +  ## Examples
       311 +  
       312 +  ### SaaS Application
       313 +  ```yaml
       314 +  operations:
       315 +    - name: "critical-user-journey"
       316 +      type: "ui-flow"
       317 +      steps:
       318 +        - { action: "navigate", target: "/" }
       319 +        - { action: "click", target: "[data-test='login']" }
       320 +        - { action: "fill", target: "#email", value: "$TEST_EMAIL" }
       321 +        - { action: "fill", target: "#password", value: "$TEST_PASS" }
       322 +        - { action: "click", target: "button[type='submit']" }
       323 +        - { action: "verify", target: ".dashboard", timeout: 5000 }
       324 +  ```
       325 +  
       326 +  ### CLI Tool
       327 +  ```yaml
       328 +  operations:
       329 +    - name: "core-commands"
       330 +      type: "system"
       331 +      steps:
       332 +        - { action: "execute", command: "my-cli --version" }
       333 +        - { action: "verify-output", contains: "v1." }
       334 +        - { action: "execute", command: "my-cli init test-project" }
       335 +        - { action: "verify-exit-code", value: 0 }
       336 +  ```
       337 +  
       338 +  ### Microservices
       339 +  ```yaml
       340 +  operations:
       341 +    - name: "service-communication"
       342 +      type: "api"

         1 +  # PRD: Universal Smoke Test Pattern for CONSTRUCT
         2 +  
         3 +  ## Executive Summary
         4 +  
         5 +  Create a smoke test pattern plugin that enables any CONSTRUCT-managed project to define and run systematic tests of their critical 
           + operations. These lightweight tests verify core functionality and capture comprehensive failure context for AI-assisted debugging.
         6 +  
         7 +  ## Problem Statement
         8 +  
         9 +  Currently, CONSTRUCT projects lack a standardized way to:
        10 +  1. Systematically test all critical operations after code changes
        11 +  2. Capture failure context in a format optimized for AI analysis
        12 +  3. Create architecture-agnostic test definitions
        13 +  4. Maintain smoke tests as living documentation of core functionality
        14 +  
        15 +  ## Goals
        16 +  
        17 +  ### Primary Goals
        18 +  1. **Universal Test Framework**: Work across web, mobile, CLI, and API architectures
        19 +  2. **AI-Optimized Reporting**: Capture failures with context for AI debugging
        20 +  3. **Configuration-Driven**: Define tests in YAML, not code
        21 +  4. **Lightweight Execution**: Complete smoke suite in <5 minutes
        22 +  
        23 +  ### Secondary Goals
        24 +  1. **Pattern Integration**: Leverage CONSTRUCT's pattern system
        25 +  2. **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration with existing pipelines
        26 +  3. **Extensible**: Support custom test types via plugins
        27 +  4. **Migration Path**: Import from existing test frameworks
        28 +  
        29 +  ## Non-Goals
        30 +  1. Full E2E test replacement (smoke tests are lightweight by design)
        31 +  2. Performance testing (separate concern)
        32 +  3. Unit test framework (project-specific choice)
        33 +  4. Test generation (future enhancement)
        34 +

       113 +    staging:
       114 +      base_url: "https://staging.example.com"
       115 +  ```
       116 +  
       117 +  ### Test Types
       118 +  
       119 +  #### 1. UI Flow Tests
       120 +  - Browser automation via Playwright
       121 +  - Mobile support via Appium
       122 +  - Visual regression capabilities
       123 +  
       124 +  #### 2. API Tests  
       125 +  - REST/GraphQL support
       126 +  - Authentication handling
       127 +  - Response validation
       128 +  
       129 +  #### 3. System Tests
       130 +  - Shell command execution
       131 +  - Exit code verification
       132 +  - Output pattern matching
       133 +  
       134 +  #### 4. Custom Tests

       136 +  - Framework-specific runners
       137 +  - Extensible step types
       138 +  
       139 +  ### Error Capture
       140 +  
       141 +  When tests fail, capture:
       142 +  1. **Visual Context**: Screenshots, recordings
       143 +  2. **Logs**: Console, application, system
       144 +  3. **Network**: Requests, responses, timing
       145 +  4. **State**: DOM, database, memory
       146 +  5. **Traces**: Stack traces, error boundaries
       147 +  
       148 +  ### AI-Optimized Reports
       149 +  
       150 +  ```markdown
       151 +  ## Smoke Test Failure: user-signup
       152 +  
       153 +  ### Failure Context
       154 +  - **Step**: 3/5 - Click submit button
       155 +  - **Error**: Element not found: #submit
       156 +  - **Duration**: 5.2s (timeout)
       157 +  
       158 +  ### Visual Evidence
       159 +  ![Screenshot](./captures/user-signup-step3.png)
       160 +  
       161 +  ### Suggested Fixes
       162 +  1. Selector may have changed
       163 +     - Current: `#submit`
       164 +     - Found similar: `button[type="submit"]` at (320, 450)
       165 +     
       166 +  2. Element may be hidden
       167 +     - Parent visibility: visible
       168 +     - Computed styles: display: none (!)
       169 +     
       170 +  3. Timing issue possible
       171 +     - Page load: complete
       172 +     - XHR pending: 2 requests
       173 +     - Consider adding wait condition
       174 +  
       175 +  ### Code Context
       176 +  ```javascript
       177 +  // Step definition
       178 +  { action: "click", target: "#submit" }
       179 +  
       180 +  // Suggested fix
       181 +  { action: "wait", target: "xhr", value: 0 }
       182 +  { action: "click", target: "button[type='submit']" }
       183 +  ```
       184 +  
       185 +  ### How to Fix
       186 +  1. Check if button selector changed in recent commits
       187 +  2. Verify button visibility conditions
       188 +  3. Add explicit wait for XHR completion
       189 +  ```
       190 +

       240 +  ## Risks and Mitigations
       241 +  
       242 +  ### Risk: Test Flakiness
       243 +  - **Mitigation**: Built-in retry logic, explicit waits, environment isolation
       244 +  
       245 +  ### Risk: Maintenance Burden
       246 +  - **Mitigation**: Configuration-driven approach, self-documenting tests
       247 +  
       248 +  ### Risk: Performance Impact
       249 +  - **Mitigation**: Parallel execution, selective running, caching
       250 +  
       251 +  ### Risk: Limited Adoption
       252 +  - **Mitigation**: Migration tools, templates, strong documentation
       253 +  
       254 +  ## Open Questions
       255 +  
       256 +  1. Should we support visual regression testing in v1?
       257 +  2. How much AI-generated fix code should we include?
       258 +  3. Should smoke tests block commits by default?
       259 +  4. What's the right balance between configuration and code?

⏺ Good question! You're right to think about existing tools. Here's what already exists:

  Git Hooks - pre-commit framework already handles running checks before commits. Instead of reinventing, we could integrate with it:

  # .pre-commit-config.yaml
  repos:
    - repo: local
      hooks:
        - id: smoke-tests
          name: Run smoke tests
          entry: construct-smoke-test run --quick
          language: system
          pass_filenames: false

  Existing Test Runners that do similar things:
  - Jest - Has snapshot testing
  - Playwright/Cypress - Already do E2E testing
  - Newman - Runs Postman collections
  - Hurl - HTTP request testing

  Better approach: Create a thin orchestration layer that:
  1. Leverages existing test runners
  2. Standardizes configuration across them
  3. Focuses on AI-friendly error reporting

  So instead of building a test runner, build a test orchestrator:

  # .construct/smoke-tests.yaml
  orchestrator:
    version: "1.0"

  runners:
    ui:
      tool: playwright  # Use existing Playwright
      config: ./playwright.config.js

    api:
      tool: hurl  # Use existing Hurl
      files: ./tests/api/*.hurl

    cli:
      tool: bats  # Use existing Bats
      files: ./tests/cli/*.bats

  smoke_suite:
    - runner: ui
      tests: ["login", "critical-path"]
    - runner: api
      tests: ["health", "auth"]
    - runner: cli
      tests: ["version", "init"]

  This way we're not duplicating effort, just providing the glue and AI-friendly reporting layer.

⏺ No, that's different! The orchestrator directory is for language detection and routing - it routes commands to appropriate language adapters
  (Swift, C#, shell scripts).

  What you're thinking of for smoke tests would be a new concept - orchestrating test runners rather than language adapters.

⏺ The existing orchestrator is specifically for:
  - Detecting project languages (Swift, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Routing CONSTRUCT commands to language-specific adapters
  - Managing multi-language contexts

  A smoke test orchestrator would be a separate tool that:
  - Orchestrates existing test runners (Jest, Playwright, etc.)
  - Aggregates results in AI-friendly format
  - Provides unified configuration across different test tools

  Two different orchestration concepts serving different purposes.

  Or as a core pattern:

  CONSTRUCT-CORE/patterns/plugins/testing/smoke-test-orchestrator/

  Since testing is fundamental to all projects (like language detection), having a test orchestrator as a core CONSTRUCT capability makes sense,
  parallel to the existing language orchestrator.

⏺ Smoke Test Orchestrator Synopsis

  Core Concept: A lightweight orchestration layer that unifies existing open-source test runners (Jest, Playwright, Hurl, etc.) under a single
  CONSTRUCT pattern, providing:

  1. Unified Configuration: One YAML file defines all smoke tests regardless of test runner
  2. AI-Optimized Reporting: When tests fail, capture maximum context in a format optimized for AI debugging
  3. Zero Lock-in: Projects can use their existing test runners; we just orchestrate them
  4. Progressive Enhancement: Start simple (just run existing tests), add features as needed

  Key Benefits:
  - For Developers: Run all critical tests with one command, regardless of tech stack
  - For AI Assistants: Get comprehensive failure context to diagnose and fix issues
  - For Projects: Document critical paths as executable tests
  - For CONSTRUCT: Extend pattern system into quality assurance

  How It Works:
  1. Projects define their smoke tests in .construct/smoke-tests.yaml
  2. Orchestrator detects which test runners are available
  3. Maps configuration to runner-specific commands
  4. Executes tests in parallel where possible
  5. Aggregates results into AI-friendly reports
  6. Integrates with git hooks and CI/CD

  Example Flow:
  # Developer runs smoke tests
  construct-smoke test

  # Orchestrator:
  # - Finds Jest tests → runs them
  # - Finds Playwright tests → runs them  
  # - Finds API tests → runs with Hurl
  # - Aggregates all results
  # - On failure: generates AI-optimized report with screenshots, logs, suggestions

  Would you like me to create the full PRD with implementation details, technical architecture, and roadmap?

⏺ Read(.construct/patterns.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 38 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Yes! Looking at the existing .construct/patterns.yaml structure, the smoke test configuration could be part of it. We could extend the pattern
  configuration to include test specifications:

  # Existing structure
  languages: ["typescript", "swift"]
  plugins: ["testing/smoke-test-orchestrator"]

  # Could add a new section:
  smoke_tests:
    runners:
      ui: playwright
      api: hurl
      unit: jest
    critical_paths:
      - name: "user-login"
        runner: ui
        spec: "tests/e2e/login.spec.ts"
      - name: "api-health"
        runner: api
        spec: "tests/api/health.hurl"

  Or even simpler - the smoke test plugin could read the existing test files based on conventions:

  No new YAML needed - the plugin could:
  1. Detect test runners from package.json, Gemfile, etc.
  2. Find test files by convention (*.spec.ts, *.test.js, *.hurl)
  3. Run all or subset based on tags/naming
  4. Generate AI reports when failures occur

  This keeps the configuration minimal and follows CONSTRUCT's pattern philosophy - the pattern handles the complexity, not configuration files.

  The user is asking me to read several key CONSTRUCT files to get better context before deciding on the smoke test orchestrator design. Let me 
  read these files to understand:

  1. How CLAUDE.md works in different contexts (root, CORE, LAB)
  2. How the pattern system works
  3. The philosophy behind CONSTRUCT
  4. How scripts are organized

  This will help me design something that fits naturally into CONSTRUCT's architecture.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a good understanding of CONSTRUCT. Let me summarize what I've learned:

  1. CONSTRUCT is a pattern-based development system that uses modular patterns to generate context-aware CLAUDE.md files
  2. Pattern plugins live in patterns/plugins/ organized by categories
  3. Projects configure patterns via .construct/patterns.yaml
  4. Scripts are organized into core/ (orchestrators), construct/ (tools), workspace/, and dev/
  5. Unix philosophy is core - do one thing well, use standard tools, keep it simple
  6. Pattern validators are part of the plugin system and can validate quality, architecture, documentation, and usage
  7. Everything is configuration-driven - no hardcoded rules

  Now, regarding the smoke test orchestrator:
  - It should follow CONSTRUCT's philosophy of leveraging existing tools
  - It should be a pattern plugin, not a separate YAML configuration
  - It should orchestrate existing test runners rather than reimplementing them
  - It should provide AI-friendly error reporting

  The smoke test orchestrator makes perfect sense as a CONSTRUCT pattern because:
  1. It follows the Unix philosophy - orchestrate existing tools rather than reinvent
  2. It's configuration-driven via patterns.yaml 
  3. It would include validators to ensure smoke tests exist
  4. It provides value to all CONSTRUCT projects

  Let me present my plan for how this would work.

⏺ Analysis: Smoke Test Orchestrator in CONSTRUCT Context

  After reading through CONSTRUCT's architecture and philosophy, here's my understanding:

  CONSTRUCT's Core Principles

  1. Pattern-based system - Everything is a modular pattern plugin
  2. Unix philosophy - Use existing tools, don't reinvent
  3. Configuration-driven - patterns.yaml controls what's active
  4. Validators included - Patterns can validate their own implementation
  5. No additional YAML files - Projects already have .construct/patterns.yaml

  Why Smoke Test Orchestrator Fits Perfectly

  The smoke test orchestrator aligns with CONSTRUCT because:
  - Leverages existing tools (Jest, Playwright, Hurl) - pure Unix philosophy
  - Pattern plugin structure - fits naturally in patterns/plugins/testing/
  - No new configuration - uses existing patterns.yaml
  - Includes validators - can check if smoke tests exist and run
  - AI-friendly reporting - core CONSTRUCT value

  How It Would Work

  1. As a Pattern Plugin: patterns/plugins/testing/smoke-test-orchestrator/
  2. Activated via: Adding to .construct/patterns.yaml
  3. Discovers test runners: Automatically finds Jest, Playwright, etc.
  4. Convention over configuration: Finds tests by naming patterns
  5. Orchestrates execution: Runs all discovered tests
  6. AI-optimized reports: Captures context when failures occur

  ⎿  Wrote 537 lines to CONSTRUCT-LAB/AI/PRDs/future/smoke-test-orchestrator-prd.md                                                                
     # PRD: Smoke Test Orchestrator Pattern for CONSTRUCT
     ## Executive Summary
     Create a CONSTRUCT pattern plugin that orchestrates existing open-source test runners (Jest, Playwright, Hurl, etc.) to provide unified smoke
     testing capabilities with AI-optimized error reporting. This follows CONSTRUCT's Unix philosophy of leveraging existing tools rather than
     reinventing them.
     ## Problem Statement
     CONSTRUCT projects currently lack a standardized way to:
     1. Run all critical smoke tests with a single command
     … +527 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I've created a comprehensive PRD for the Smoke Test Orchestrator pattern at
  /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/CONSTRUCT-LAB/AI/PRDs/future/smoke-test-orchestrator-prd.md.

  The PRD includes:

  1. Executive Summary - Quick overview of the solution
  2. Problem Statement - Clear articulation of what we're solving
  3. Goals and Non-Goals - What we will and won't do
  4. User Stories - Perspectives from developers, AI assistants, and DevOps
  5. Technical Design - Detailed architecture and implementation
  6. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide - 9 concrete steps to build and test
  7. Success Metrics - How we'll measure success
  8. Risk Mitigation - Potential issues and solutions
  9. Future Enhancements - Roadmap for versions 2.0 and 3.0

  Key highlights:
  - Zero configuration by default - detects and runs existing tests
  - Leverages existing tools - Jest, Playwright, Hurl, etc.
  - AI-optimized reporting - comprehensive failure context
  - Fits CONSTRUCT pattern system - natural integration
  - Unix philosophy - orchestrate, don't reinvent

  The implementation guide provides concrete steps to create, test, and deploy this pattern, starting in CONSTRUCT-LAB and eventually promoting to
  CORE after validation.

⏺ Update Todos
