⏺ I've successfully read all four CLAUDE.md files. Here's a summary of what each contains:

  1. CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE.md - Template for user projects with Swift/iOS development patterns
  2. CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE-BASE.md - Universal development principles that apply to all projects
  3. CONSTRUCT/CLAUDE.md (root) - CONSTRUCT development guide explaining the system architecture
  4. CONSTRUCT-LAB/CLAUDE.md - Development context for working on CONSTRUCT itself

  The files show that CONSTRUCT is a dual-environment development system with:
  - CONSTRUCT-CORE: Stable, production-ready patterns and tools
  - CONSTRUCT-LAB: Development and experimentation environment
  - Pattern System: Modular, reusable development patterns
  - Context Engineering: Auto-updating documentation
  - Promotion Workflow: Safe path from LAB to CORE

  Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding these files or the CONSTRUCT system?

> ok, CONSTRUCT makes sense to you? /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/CONSTRUCT/README.md

⏺ I'll read the README to get a complete understanding of CONSTRUCT.

⏺ Yes, CONSTRUCT makes perfect sense! It's a brilliant solution to the context management problem in AI-powered development. Here's my
  understanding:

  Core Insight: CONSTRUCT recognizes that Claude Code fundamentally changed development from "editing code" to "managing context". The problem
  isn't writing better prompts - it's dynamically assembling the right context for what you're actually doing.

  Key Innovation: Instead of static rules that you paste at the start of every session, CONSTRUCT provides:
  - Dynamic pattern loading based on current task
  - Pattern plugin ecosystem (like Homebrew for AI context)
  - Self-improving patterns that learn from usage
  - Architecture-aware integrations that match your style

  Architecture:
  - CONSTRUCT-CORE: Stable, proven patterns (like brew formulae)
  - CONSTRUCT-LAB: Pattern development/experimentation (like brew taps)
  - Projects: Your managed projects with pattern configurations

  Practical Impact: Instead of spending hours integrating Stripe and refactoring to match your architecture, just run construct add 
  integration/stripe and get properly architected code that looks hand-written.

  The philosophy resonates strongly - "Context > Prompts", "Dynamic > Static", "Patterns > Templates", "Community > Committee". It's solving a real
   pain point that every Claude Code user faces: teaching the AI your patterns every single session.

  Is there something specific about CONSTRUCT you'd like to explore or work on?
