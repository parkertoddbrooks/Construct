# CONSTRUCT Architecture Cheat Sheet

## 🎯 Quick Reference - What Goes Where

### CLAUDE.md Files

| File | Purpose | How It's Created |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `/CONSTRUCT/CLAUDE.md` | CONSTRUCT system documentation + Orchestrator | 1. `/init` creates it<br>2. `construct-init.sh` enhances with CONSTRUCT awareness<br>3. Teaches dynamic context loading |
| `CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE-BASE.md` | Template for ALL project CLAUDE.md files | Hand-written, universal template |
| `CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE.md` | Legacy iOS-specific (from RUN) | TO BE REMOVED - content moved to patterns |
| `Projects/*/CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific context | Generated: CLAUDE-BASE.md + patterns |

### Pattern System Flow

```
Project runs: construct-patterns regenerate
↓
Reads: .construct/patterns.yaml
↓
Loads: CLAUDE-BASE.md (template)
↓
Adds: Pattern files (swift.md, mvvm.md, etc.)
↓
Adds: Language-specific scripts
↓
Creates: Project's CLAUDE.md
```

### Key Directories

```
CONSTRUCT/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # CONSTRUCT system docs (from /init)
├── CONSTRUCT-CORE/
│   ├── CLAUDE-BASE.md          # Template for project CLAUDE.md files
│   ├── patterns/               # Built-in patterns
│   └── CONSTRUCT/scripts/      # All the tools
├── CONSTRUCT-LAB/
│   ├── patterns/               # Plugin patterns
│   └── [NO CLAUDE.md needed]
└── Projects/
    └── MyApp/
        ├── .construct/patterns.yaml  # Project config
        └── CLAUDE.md                 # Generated from BASE + patterns
```

### Context Engineering Scripts
- `update-context.sh`: Refreshes dynamic sections in `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., project state).
- `check-architecture.sh`: Validates patterns, feeds into `VIOLATIONS`.
- `session-summary.sh`: Tracks pattern changes across sessions.
- `pre-commit`: Ensures fresh context before commits.
- `check-quality.sh`: Validates code against pattern standards.
- `workspace-status.sh`: Shows pattern usage across projects.

### The Abstraction Story

1. **Origin**: CONSTRUCT was built inside RUN (iOS app).
2. **Current**: Extracting it to work with any language/platform.
3. **Challenge**: iOS-specific stuff mixed with universal concepts.
4. **Solution**: Move iOS stuff to pattern files, keep universal in BASE.

### Common Confusions Cleared

❌ **WRONG**: "CLAUDE-BASE.md is minimal universal principles"
✅ **RIGHT**: "CLAUDE-BASE.md is the complete template for generating project CLAUDE.md files"

❌ **WRONG**: "Multiple CLAUDE.md files for CONSTRUCT system"
✅ **RIGHT**: "One CLAUDE.md at root for CONSTRUCT, each project gets its own"

❌ **WRONG**: "We control /init"
✅ **RIGHT**: "/init creates root CLAUDE.md, we enhance it afterwards"

### Quick Commands

```bash
# From project directory with .construct/patterns.yaml:
construct-patterns regenerate    # Creates/updates project CLAUDE.md
create-project.sh --show-prompts  # Show inputs for project creation
import-project.sh --show-prompts  # Show inputs for project import
check context                    # Detect and load current context
load project MyApp/ios           # Load specific project context
refresh patterns                 # Regenerate CLAUDE.md

# From CONSTRUCT root:
construct-init.sh                # Enhances /init output with CONSTRUCT awareness
```

### Dynamic Context Loading (Runtime)

Once CLAUDE.md files are generated, Claude Code can dynamically switch contexts:

```bash
# Claude can execute these commands to load appropriate context:
pwd                                    # Where am I working?
cat Projects/MyApp/ios/CLAUDE.md       # Load iOS project context
cat Projects/MyApp/backend/CLAUDE.md   # Load backend context
cat CONSTRUCT-LAB/AI/PRDs/current/*    # Load current development goals
```

The root `/CONSTRUCT/CLAUDE.md` acts as an orchestrator that teaches Claude how to:
1. Detect which project you're working on
2. Load the appropriate pattern-generated context
3. Switch contexts within a single conversation

### What Needs Extraction

From `CONSTRUCT-CORE/CLAUDE.md` → Pattern files:
- iOS Configuration Rules → `patterns/platforms/ios.md`
- Swift 6 Concurrency → `patterns/languages/swift.md`
- SwiftUI patterns → `patterns/frameworks/swiftui.md`
- MVVM patterns → `patterns/architecture/mvvm-ios.md`

**Remember**: CONSTRUCT is becoming language-agnostic. iOS was just the beginning.
